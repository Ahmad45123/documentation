The library collects security data from your application and sends it to the Agent, which sends it to Datadog to be used in alerts, reports, queries, and dashboards to help you monitor security happenings in your application. 

A few minutes after you enabling your application and exercise it, data will appear in the [Application Security Explorer page][101] in Datadog.
