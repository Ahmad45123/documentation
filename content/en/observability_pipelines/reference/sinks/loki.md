# Configuration
<table><thead><tr><td>Param</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>acknowledgements</td><td>Controls how acknowledgements are handled for this sink.

See [End-to-end Acknowledgements][e2e_acks] for more information on how event acknowledgement is handled.

[e2e_acks]: https://vector.dev/docs/about/under-the-hood/architecture/end-to-end-acknowledgements/</td></tr><tr><td>acknowledgements.enabled</td><td>Whether or not end-to-end acknowledgements are enabled.

When enabled for a sink, any source connected to that sink, where the source supports
end-to-end acknowledgements as well, will wait for events to be acknowledged by the sink
before acknowledging them at the source.

Enabling or disabling acknowledgements at the sink level takes precedence over any global
[`acknowledgements`][global_acks] configuration.

[global_acks]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/global-options/#acknowledgements</td></tr><tr><td>auth</td><td>Configuration of the authentication strategy for HTTP requests.

HTTP authentication should almost always be used with HTTPS only, as the authentication credentials are passed as an
HTTP header without any additional encryption beyond what is provided by the transport itself.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.password</td><td>The basic authentication password.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.strategy</td><td>The authentication strategy to use.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.token</td><td>The bearer authentication token.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.user</td><td>The basic authentication username.</td></tr><tr><td>batch</td><td>Event batching behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>batch.max_bytes</td><td>The maximum size of a batch that will be processed by a sink.

This is based on the uncompressed size of the batched events, before they are
serialized / compressed.</td></tr><tr><td>batch.max_events</td><td>The maximum size of a batch before it is flushed.</td></tr><tr><td>batch.timeout_secs</td><td>The maximum age of a batch before it is flushed.</td></tr><tr><td>compression</td><td>Compression configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding</td><td>Configures how events are encoded into raw bytes.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.avro</td><td>Apache Avro-specific encoder options.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.avro.schema</td><td>The Avro schema.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.codec</td><td>The codec to use for encoding events.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.csv</td><td>The CSV Serializer Options.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.csv.fields</td><td>Configures the fields that will be encoded, as well as the order in which they
appear in the output.

If a field is not present in the event, the output will be an empty string.

Values of type `Array`, `Object`, and `Regex` are not supported and the
output will be an empty string.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.except_fields</td><td>List of fields that will be excluded from the encoded event.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.metric_tag_values</td><td>Controls how metric tag values are encoded.

When set to `single`, only the last non-bare value of tags will be displayed with the
metric.  When set to `full`, all metric tags will be exposed as separate assignments.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.only_fields</td><td>List of fields that will be included in the encoded event.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.timestamp_format</td><td>Format used for timestamp fields.</td></tr><tr><td>endpoint</td><td>The base URL of the Loki instance.

The `path` value is appended to this.</td></tr><tr><td>labels</td><td>A set of labels that are attached to each batch of events.

Both keys and values are templateable, which enables you to attach dynamic labels to events.

Valid label keys include `*`, and prefixes ending with `*`, to allow for the expansion of
objects into multiple labels. See [Label expansion][label_expansion] for more information.

Note: If the set of labels has high cardinality, this can cause drastic performance issues
with Loki. To prevent this from happening, reduce the number of unique label keys and
values.

[label_expansion]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/loki/#label-expansion</td></tr><tr><td>labels.*</td><td>A Loki label.</td></tr><tr><td>out_of_order_action</td><td>Out-of-order event behavior.

Some sources may generate events with timestamps that aren’t in chronological order. While the
sink will sort events before sending them to Loki, there is the chance another event comes in
that is out-of-order with respective the latest events sent to Loki. Prior to Loki 2.4.0, this
was not supported and would result in an error during the push request.

If you're using Loki 2.4.0 or newer, `Accept` is the preferred action, which lets Loki handle
any necessary sorting/reordering. If you're using an earlier version, then you must use `Drop`
or `RewriteTimestamp` depending on which option makes the most sense for your use case.</td></tr><tr><td>path</td><td>The path to use in the URL of the Loki instance.</td></tr><tr><td>remove_label_fields</td><td>Whether or not to delete fields from the event when they are used as labels.</td></tr><tr><td>remove_timestamp</td><td>Whether or not to remove the timestamp from the event payload.

The timestamp will still be sent as event metadata for Loki to use for indexing.</td></tr><tr><td>request</td><td>Middleware settings for outbound requests.

Various settings can be configured, such as concurrency and rate limits, timeouts, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>request.adaptive_concurrency</td><td>Configuration of adaptive concurrency parameters.

These parameters typically do not require changes from the default, and incorrect values can lead to meta-stable or
unstable performance and sink behavior. Proceed with caution.</td></tr><tr><td>request.adaptive_concurrency.decrease_ratio</td><td>The fraction of the current value to set the new concurrency limit when decreasing the limit.

Valid values are greater than `0` and less than `1`. Smaller values cause the algorithm to scale back rapidly
when latency increases.

Note that the new limit is rounded down after applying this ratio.</td></tr><tr><td>request.adaptive_concurrency.ewma_alpha</td><td>The weighting of new measurements compared to older measurements.

Valid values are greater than `0` and less than `1`.

ARC uses an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of past RTT measurements as a reference to compare with
the current RTT. Smaller values cause this reference to adjust more slowly, which may be useful if a service has
unusually high response variability.</td></tr><tr><td>request.adaptive_concurrency.rtt_deviation_scale</td><td>Scale of RTT deviations which are not considered anomalous.

Valid values are greater than or equal to `0`, and we expect reasonable values to range from `1.0` to `3.0`.

When calculating the past RTT average, we also compute a secondary “deviation” value that indicates how variable
those values are. We use that deviation when comparing the past RTT average to the current measurements, so we
can ignore increases in RTT that are within an expected range. This factor is used to scale up the deviation to
an appropriate range.  Larger values cause the algorithm to ignore larger increases in the RTT.</td></tr><tr><td>request.concurrency</td><td>Configuration for outbound request concurrency.</td></tr><tr><td>request.rate_limit_duration_secs</td><td>The time window used for the `rate_limit_num` option.</td></tr><tr><td>request.rate_limit_num</td><td>The maximum number of requests allowed within the `rate_limit_duration_secs` time window.</td></tr><tr><td>request.retry_attempts</td><td>The maximum number of retries to make for failed requests.

The default, for all intents and purposes, represents an infinite number of retries.</td></tr><tr><td>request.retry_initial_backoff_secs</td><td>The amount of time to wait before attempting the first retry for a failed request.

After the first retry has failed, the fibonacci sequence will be used to select future backoffs.</td></tr><tr><td>request.retry_max_duration_secs</td><td>The maximum amount of time to wait between retries.</td></tr><tr><td>request.timeout_secs</td><td>The time a request can take before being aborted.

It is highly recommended that you do not lower this value below the service’s internal timeout, as this could
create orphaned requests, pile on retries, and result in duplicate data downstream.</td></tr><tr><td>tenant_id</td><td>The [tenant ID][tenant_id] to specify in requests to Loki.

When running Loki locally, a tenant ID is not required.

[tenant_id]: https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/operations/multi-tenancy/</td></tr><tr><td>inputs</td><td>A list of upstream [source][sources] or [transform][transforms] IDs.

Must be at least ~256 megabytes (268435488 bytes).</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.type</td><td>The type of buffer to use.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.when_full</td><td>Event handling behavior when a buffer is full.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy</td><td>Proxy configuration.

Configure to proxy traffic through an HTTP(S) proxy when making external requests.

Similar to common proxy configuration convention, users can set different proxies
to use based on the type of traffic being proxied, as well as set specific hosts that
should not be proxied.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy.enabled</td><td>Enables proxying support.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy.http</td><td>Proxy endpoint to use when proxying HTTP traffic.

Declare the supported ALPN protocols, which are used during negotiation with peer. Prioritized in the order
they are defined.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.ca_file</td><td>Absolute path to an additional CA certificate file.

The certificate must be in the DER or PEM (X.509) format. Additionally, the certificate can be provided as an inline string in PEM format.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.crt_file</td><td>Absolute path to a certificate file used to identify this server.

The certificate must be in DER, PEM (X.509), or PKCS#12 format. Additionally, the certificate can be provided as
an inline string in PEM format.

If this is set, and is not a PKCS#12 archive, `key_file` must also be set.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.key_file</td><td>Absolute path to a private key file used to identify this server.

The key must be in DER or PEM (PKCS#8) format. Additionally, the key can be provided as an inline string in PEM format.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.key_pass</td><td>Passphrase used to unlock the encrypted key file.

This has no effect unless `key_file` is set.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.verify_certificate</td><td>Enables certificate verification.

If enabled, certificates must be valid in terms of not being expired, as well as being issued by a trusted
issuer. This verification operates in a hierarchical manner, checking that not only the leaf certificate (the
certificate presented by the client/server) is valid, but also that the issuer of that certificate is valid, and
so on until reaching a root certificate.

Relevant for both incoming and outgoing connections.

Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the validity of certificates.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.verify_hostname</td><td>Enables hostname verification.

If enabled, the hostname used to connect to the remote host must be present in the TLS certificate presented by
the remote host, either as the Common Name or as an entry in the Subject Alternative Name extension.

Only relevant for outgoing connections.

Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the remote hostname.</td></tr><tr><td>healthcheck</td><td>Healthcheck configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>healthcheck.enabled</td><td>Whether or not to check the health of the sink when Vector starts up.</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>The component type.

# How It Works
## Decentralized Deployments
Loki currently does not support out-of-order inserts. If
Vector is deployed in a decentralized setup then there is
the possibility that logs might get rejected due to data
races between Vector instances. To avoid this we suggest
either assigning each Vector instance with a unique label
or deploying a centralized Vector which will ensure no logs
will get sent out-of-order.

## Event Ordering
The `loki` sink will ensure that all logs are sorted via
their `timestamp`. This is to ensure that logs will be
accepted by Loki. If no timestamp is supplied with events
then the Loki sink will supply its own monotonically
increasing timestamp.

## Label Expansion
The `labels` option can be passed keys with `*` or prefixes ending with `*` to
allow for setting multiple keys based on the contents of an object. Static keys
override dynamically defined keys. For example, with an object:

```json
{
	"kubernetes": {
		"pod_labels": {
			"app": "web-server",
			"name": "unicorn"
		}
	},
	"metadata": {
		"cluster_name": "operations",
		"cluster_environment": "development",
		"cluster_version": "1.2.3"
	}
}
```

and a configuration:

```toml
[sinks.my_sink_id.labels]
"pod_labels_*": "{{ kubernetes.pod_labels }}"
"*": "{{ metadata }}"
cluster_name: static_cluster_name
```

this would expand into the following labels:

```toml
pod_labels_app: web-server
pod_labels_name: unicorn
cluster_name: static_cluster_name
cluster_environment: development
cluster_version: 1.2.3

## State
This component is stateless, meaning its behavior is consistent across each input.

## Health checks
Health checks ensure that the downstream service is
accessible and ready to accept data. This check is performed
upon sink initialization. If the health check fails an error
will be logged and Vector will proceed to start.

## Rate limits & adaptive concurrency
null

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Vector uses [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) for TLS protocols due to OpenSSL's maturity. You can
enable and adjust TLS behavior using the [`tls.*`](#tls) options.

## Buffers and batches
This component buffers & batches data as shown in the diagram above. You'll notice that
Vector treats these concepts differently, instead of treating them as global concepts,
Vector treats them as sink specific concepts. This isolates sinks, ensuring services
disruptions are contained and delivery guarantees are honored.

*Batches* are flushed when 1 of 2 conditions are met:

1. The batch age meets or exceeds the configured `timeout_secs`.
2. The batch size meets or exceeds the configured `max_bytes` or `max_events`.

*Buffers* are controlled via the [`buffer.*`](#buffer) options.

## Request Encoding
Loki can receive log entries as either protobuf or JSON requests.
Protobuf requests are snappy compressed. JSON requests have either
no compression or can be gzip compressed.

For the `loki` sink this means the body will be encoded based
on the configured `compression`.

## Retry policy
Vector will retry failed requests (status == 429, >= 500, and != 501).
Other responses will not be retried. You can control the number of
retry attempts and backoff rate with the `request.retry_attempts` and
`request.retry_backoff_secs` options.
