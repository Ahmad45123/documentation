# Configuration
<table><thead><tr><td>Param</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>acknowledgements</td><td>Controls how acknowledgements are handled for this sink.

See [End-to-end Acknowledgements][e2e_acks] for more information on how event acknowledgement is handled.

[e2e_acks]: https://vector.dev/docs/about/under-the-hood/architecture/end-to-end-acknowledgements/</td></tr><tr><td>acknowledgements.enabled</td><td>Whether or not end-to-end acknowledgements are enabled.

When enabled for a sink, any source connected to that sink, where the source supports
end-to-end acknowledgements as well, will wait for events to be acknowledged by the sink
before acknowledging them at the source.

Enabling or disabling acknowledgements at the sink level takes precedence over any global
[`acknowledgements`][global_acks] configuration.

[global_acks]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/global-options/#acknowledgements</td></tr><tr><td>connection_string</td><td>URI for the AMQP server.

The URI has the format of
`amqp://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<vhost>?timeout=<seconds>`.

The default vhost can be specified by using a value of `%2f`.

In order to connect over TLS, a scheme of `amqps` can be specified instead i.e.
`amqps://...`. Additional TLS settings, such as client certificate verification, etc, can be
configured under the `tls` section.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding</td><td>Configures how events are encoded into raw bytes.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.avro</td><td>Apache Avro-specific encoder options.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.avro.schema</td><td>The Avro schema.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.codec</td><td>The codec to use for encoding events.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.csv</td><td>The CSV Serializer Options.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.csv.fields</td><td>Configures the fields that will be encoded, as well as the order in which they
appear in the output.

If a field is not present in the event, the output will be an empty string.

Values of type `Array`, `Object`, and `Regex` are not supported and the
output will be an empty string.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.except_fields</td><td>List of fields that will be excluded from the encoded event.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.metric_tag_values</td><td>Controls how metric tag values are encoded.

When set to `single`, only the last non-bare value of tags will be displayed with the
metric.  When set to `full`, all metric tags will be exposed as separate assignments.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.only_fields</td><td>List of fields that will be included in the encoded event.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.timestamp_format</td><td>Format used for timestamp fields.</td></tr><tr><td>exchange</td><td>The exchange to publish messages to.</td></tr><tr><td>routing_key</td><td>Template used to generate a routing key which corresponds to a queue binding.</td></tr><tr><td>inputs</td><td>A list of upstream [source][sources] or [transform][transforms] IDs.

Wildcards (`*`) are supported.

See [configuration][configuration] for more info.

[sources]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sources/
[transforms]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/transforms/
[configuration]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/</td></tr><tr><td>buffer</td><td>Configures the buffering behavior for this sink.

More information about the individual buffer types, and buffer behavior, can be found in the
[Buffering Model][buffering_model] section.

[buffering_model]: /docs/about/under-the-hood/architecture/buffering-model/</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.max_events</td><td>The maximum number of events allowed in the buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.max_size</td><td>The maximum size of the buffer on disk.

Must be at least ~256 megabytes (268435488 bytes).</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.type</td><td>The type of buffer to use.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.when_full</td><td>Event handling behavior when a buffer is full.</td></tr><tr><td>tls</td><td>TLS configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.alpn_protocols</td><td>Sets the list of supported ALPN protocols.

Declare the supported ALPN protocols, which are used during negotiation with peer. Prioritized in the order
they are defined.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.ca_file</td><td>Absolute path to an additional CA certificate file.

The certificate must be in the DER or PEM (X.509) format. Additionally, the certificate can be provided as an inline string in PEM format.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.crt_file</td><td>Absolute path to a certificate file used to identify this server.

The certificate must be in DER, PEM (X.509), or PKCS#12 format. Additionally, the certificate can be provided as
an inline string in PEM format.

If this is set, and is not a PKCS#12 archive, `key_file` must also be set.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.key_file</td><td>Absolute path to a private key file used to identify this server.

The key must be in DER or PEM (PKCS#8) format. Additionally, the key can be provided as an inline string in PEM format.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.key_pass</td><td>Passphrase used to unlock the encrypted key file.

This has no effect unless `key_file` is set.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.verify_certificate</td><td>Enables certificate verification.

If enabled, certificates must be valid in terms of not being expired, as well as being issued by a trusted
issuer. This verification operates in a hierarchical manner, checking that not only the leaf certificate (the
certificate presented by the client/server) is valid, but also that the issuer of that certificate is valid, and
so on until reaching a root certificate.

Relevant for both incoming and outgoing connections.

Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the validity of certificates.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.verify_hostname</td><td>Enables hostname verification.

If enabled, the hostname used to connect to the remote host must be present in the TLS certificate presented by
the remote host, either as the Common Name or as an entry in the Subject Alternative Name extension.

Only relevant for outgoing connections.

Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the remote hostname.</td></tr><tr><td>healthcheck</td><td>Healthcheck configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>healthcheck.enabled</td><td>Whether or not to check the health of the sink when Vector starts up.</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>The component type. This is a required field for all components and tells Vector which component to use.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# Output Data

# Telemetry
<table></tbody><tr><td>events_discarded_total</td><td>The total number of events discarded by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_events_count</td><td>A histogram of the number of events passed in each internal batch in Vector's internal topology.

Note that this is separate than sink-level batching. It is mostly useful for low level debugging
performance issues in Vector due to small internal batches.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_events_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of event bytes accepted by this component either from
tagged origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>events_in_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.
This metric is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use [`component_received_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_received_events_total) instead.</td></tr><tr><td>utilization</td><td>A ratio from 0 to 1 of the load on a component. A value of 0 would indicate a completely idle component that is simply waiting for input. A value of 1 would indicate a that is never idle. This value is updated every 5 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_byte_size</td><td>The number of bytes current in the buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_events</td><td>The number of events currently in the buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_received_events_total</td><td>The number of events received by this buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_received_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of bytes received by this buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_sent_events_total</td><td>The number of events sent by this buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_sent_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of bytes sent by this buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>processing_errors_total</td><td>The total number of processing errors encountered by this component. This metric is deprecated in favor of `component_errors_total`.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_discarded_events_total</td><td>The number of events dropped by this non-blocking buffer.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# How It Works
## Lapin
The `amqp` source and sink uses [`lapin`](https://crates.io/crates/lapin) under the hood. This
is a reliable pure rust library that facilitates communication with AMQP servers
such as RabbitMQ.

## State
This component is stateless, meaning its behavior is consistent across each input.

## Health checks
Health checks ensure that the downstream service is
accessible and ready to accept data. This check is performed
upon sink initialization. If the health check fails an error
will be logged and Vector will proceed to start.

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Vector uses [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) for TLS protocols due to OpenSSL's maturity. You can
enable and adjust TLS behavior using the [`tls.*`](#tls) options.
