# Configuration
<table><thead><tr><td>Param</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>acknowledgements</td><td>Controls how acknowledgements are handled for this sink.

See [End-to-end Acknowledgements][e2e_acks] for more information on how event acknowledgement is handled.

[e2e_acks]: https://vector.dev/docs/about/under-the-hood/architecture/end-to-end-acknowledgements/</td></tr><tr><td>acknowledgements.enabled</td><td>Whether or not end-to-end acknowledgements are enabled.

When enabled for a sink, any source connected to that sink, where the source supports
end-to-end acknowledgements as well, will wait for events to be acknowledged by the sink
before acknowledging them at the source.

Enabling or disabling acknowledgements at the sink level takes precedence over any global
[`acknowledgements`][global_acks] configuration.

[global_acks]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/global-options/#acknowledgements</td></tr><tr><td>compression</td><td>Compression algorithm.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding</td><td>Configures how events are encoded into raw bytes.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.avro</td><td>Apache Avro-specific encoder options.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.avro.schema</td><td>The Avro schema.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.codec</td><td>The codec to use for encoding events.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.except_fields</td><td>List of fields that will be excluded from the encoded event.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.metric_tag_values</td><td>Controls how metric tag values are encoded.

When set to `single`, only the last non-bare value of tags will be displayed with the
metric.  When set to `full`, all metric tags will be exposed as separate assignments.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.only_fields</td><td>List of fields that will be included in the encoded event.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.timestamp_format</td><td>Format used for timestamp fields.</td></tr><tr><td>framing</td><td>Framing configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>framing.character_delimited</td><td>Options for the character delimited encoder.</td></tr><tr><td>framing.character_delimited.delimiter</td><td>The ASCII (7-bit) character that delimits byte sequences.</td></tr><tr><td>framing.method</td><td>The framing method.</td></tr><tr><td>root</td><td>Root path of webhdfs services.</td></tr><tr><td>prefix</td><td>	A prefix to apply to all keys.

	Prefixes are useful for partitioning objects, such as by creating an blob key that stores blobs under a particular "directory". If using a prefix for this purpose, it must end in `/` to act as a directory path. A trailing `/` is **not**</td></tr><tr><td>inputs</td><td>A list of upstream [source][sources] or [transform][transforms] IDs.

Wildcards (`*`) are supported.

See [configuration][configuration] for more info.

More information about the individual buffer types, and buffer behavior, can be found in the
[Buffering Model][buffering_model] section.

[buffering_model]: /docs/about/under-the-hood/architecture/buffering-model/</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.max_events</td><td>The maximum number of events allowed in the buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.max_size</td><td>The maximum size of the buffer on disk.

Must be at least ~256 megabytes (268435488 bytes).</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.type</td><td>The type of buffer to use.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.when_full</td><td>Event handling behavior when a buffer is full.</td></tr><tr><td>endpoint</td><td>	An hdfs cluster consists of a single NameNode, a master server that manages the file system namespace and regulates access to files by clients.

	For example:

	- `http://172.16.80.2:8090` visiting name node's webhdfs port at `172.16.80.2:8090`

This is a required field for all components and tells Vector which component to use.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# Output Data

# Telemetry
<table></tbody><tr><td>component_sent_bytes_total</td><td>The number of raw bytes sent by this component to destination sinks.</td></tr><tr><td>component_sent_events_total</td><td>The total number of events emitted by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_events_count</td><td>A histogram of the number of events passed in each internal batch in Vector's internal topology.

Note that this is separate than sink-level batching. It is mostly useful for low level debugging
performance issues in Vector due to small internal batches.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_events_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of event bytes accepted by this component either from
tagged origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>events_in_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.
This metric is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use [`component_received_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_received_events_total) instead.</td></tr><tr><td>utilization</td><td>A ratio from 0 to 1 of the load on a component. A value of 0 would indicate a completely idle component that is simply waiting for input. A value of 1 would indicate a that is never idle. This value is updated every 5 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_byte_size</td><td>The number of bytes current in the buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_events</td><td>The number of events currently in the buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_received_events_total</td><td>The number of events received by this buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_received_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of bytes received by this buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_sent_events_total</td><td>The number of events sent by this buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_sent_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of bytes sent by this buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>component_sent_event_bytes_total</td><td>The total number of event bytes emitted by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_discarded_events_total</td><td>The number of events dropped by this non-blocking buffer.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# How It Works
## State
This component is stateless, meaning its behavior is consistent across each input.

## Health checks
Health checks ensure that the downstream service is
accessible and ready to accept data. This check is performed
upon sink initialization. If the health check fails an error
will be logged and Vector will proceed to start.
