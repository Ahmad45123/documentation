# Configuration
<table><thead><tr><td>Param</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>acknowledgements</td><td>Controls how acknowledgements are handled for this sink.

See [End-to-end Acknowledgements][e2e_acks] for more information on how event acknowledgement is handled.

[e2e_acks]: https://vector.dev/docs/about/under-the-hood/architecture/end-to-end-acknowledgements/</td></tr><tr><td>acknowledgements.enabled</td><td>Whether or not end-to-end acknowledgements are enabled.

When enabled for a sink, any source connected to that sink, where the source supports
end-to-end acknowledgements as well, will wait for events to be acknowledged by the sink
before acknowledging them at the source.

Enabling or disabling acknowledgements at the sink level takes precedence over any global
[`acknowledgements`][global_acks] configuration.

[global_acks]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/global-options/#acknowledgements</td></tr><tr><td>auth</td><td>Configuration of the authentication strategy for HTTP requests.

HTTP authentication should almost always be used with HTTPS only, as the authentication credentials are passed as an
HTTP header without any additional encryption beyond what is provided by the transport itself.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.password</td><td>The basic authentication password.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.strategy</td><td>The authentication strategy to use.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.token</td><td>The bearer authentication token.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.user</td><td>The basic authentication username.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding</td><td>Configures how events are encoded into raw bytes.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.avro</td><td>Apache Avro-specific encoder options.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.avro.schema</td><td>The Avro schema.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.codec</td><td>The codec to use for encoding events.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.csv</td><td>The CSV Serializer Options.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.csv.fields</td><td>Configures the fields that will be encoded, as well as the order in which they
appear in the output.

If a field is not present in the event, the output will be an empty string.

Values of type `Array`, `Object`, and `Regex` are not supported and the
output will be an empty string.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.except_fields</td><td>List of fields that will be excluded from the encoded event.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.metric_tag_values</td><td>Controls how metric tag values are encoded.

When set to `single`, only the last non-bare value of tags will be displayed with the
metric.  When set to `full`, all metric tags will be exposed as separate assignments.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.only_fields</td><td>List of fields that will be included in the encoded event.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding.timestamp_format</td><td>Format used for timestamp fields.</td></tr><tr><td>ping_interval</td><td>The interval, in seconds, between sending [Ping][ping]s to the remote peer.

If this option is not configured, pings are not sent on an interval.

If the `ping_timeout` is not set, pings are still sent but there is no expectation of pong
response times.

[ping]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455#section-5.5.2</td></tr><tr><td>ping_timeout</td><td>The number of seconds to wait for a [Pong][pong] response from the remote peer.

If a response is not received within this time, the connection is re-established.

[pong]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455#section-5.5.3</td></tr><tr><td>tls</td><td>Configures the TLS options for incoming/outgoing connections.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.alpn_protocols</td><td>Sets the list of supported ALPN protocols.

Declare the supported ALPN protocols, which are used during negotiation with peer. Prioritized in the order
they are defined.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.ca_file</td><td>Absolute path to an additional CA certificate file.

The certificate must be in the DER or PEM (X.509) format. Additionally, the certificate can be provided as an inline string in PEM format.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.crt_file</td><td>Absolute path to a certificate file used to identify this server.

The certificate must be in DER, PEM (X.509), or PKCS#12 format. Additionally, the certificate can be provided as
an inline string in PEM format.

If this is set, and is not a PKCS#12 archive, `key_file` must also be set.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.enabled</td><td>Whether or not to require TLS for incoming/outgoing connections.

When enabled and used for incoming connections, an identity certificate is also required. See `tls.crt_file` for
more information.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.key_file</td><td>Absolute path to a private key file used to identify this server.

The key must be in DER or PEM (PKCS#8) format. Additionally, the key can be provided as an inline string in PEM format.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.key_pass</td><td>Passphrase used to unlock the encrypted key file.

This has no effect unless `key_file` is set.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.verify_certificate</td><td>Enables certificate verification.

If enabled, certificates must be valid in terms of not being expired, as well as being issued by a trusted
issuer. This verification operates in a hierarchical manner, checking that not only the leaf certificate (the
certificate presented by the client/server) is valid, but also that the issuer of that certificate is valid, and
so on until reaching a root certificate.

Relevant for both incoming and outgoing connections.

Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the validity of certificates.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.verify_hostname</td><td>Enables hostname verification.

If enabled, the hostname used to connect to the remote host must be present in the TLS certificate presented by
the remote host, either as the Common Name or as an entry in the Subject Alternative Name extension.

Only relevant for outgoing connections.

Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the remote hostname.</td></tr><tr><td>inputs</td><td>A list of upstream [source][sources] or [transform][transforms] IDs.

Wildcards (`*`) are supported.

See [configuration][configuration] for more info.

[sources]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sources/
[transforms]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/transforms/

More information about the individual buffer types, and buffer behavior, can be found in the
[Buffering Model][buffering_model] section.

[buffering_model]: /docs/about/under-the-hood/architecture/buffering-model/</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.max_events</td><td>The maximum number of events allowed in the buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.max_size</td><td>The maximum size of the buffer on disk.

Must be at least ~256 megabytes (268435488 bytes).</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.type</td><td>The type of buffer to use.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer.when_full</td><td>Event handling behavior when a buffer is full.</td></tr><tr><td>uri</td><td>The WebSocket URI to connect to.

This should include the protocol and host, but can also include the port, path, and any other valid part of a URI.</td></tr><tr><td>healthcheck</td><td>Healthcheck configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>healthcheck.enabled</td><td>Whether or not to check the health of the sink when Vector starts up.</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>The component type. This is a required field for all components and tells Vector which component to use.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Note that this is separate than sink-level batching. It is mostly useful for low level debugging
performance issues in Vector due to small internal batches.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_events_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of event bytes accepted by this component either from
tagged origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>events_in_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.
This metric is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use [`component_received_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_received_events_total) instead.</td></tr><tr><td>utilization</td><td>A ratio from 0 to 1 of the load on a component. A value of 0 would indicate a completely idle component that is simply waiting for input. A value of 1 would indicate a that is never idle. This value is updated every 5 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_byte_size</td><td>The number of bytes current in the buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_events</td><td>The number of events currently in the buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_received_events_total</td><td>The number of events received by this buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_received_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of bytes received by this buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_sent_events_total</td><td>The number of events sent by this buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>buffer_sent_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of bytes sent by this buffer.</td></tr><tr><td>events_out_total</td><td>The total number of events emitted by this component.

# How It Works
## State
This component is stateless, meaning its behavior is consistent across each input.

## Health checks
Health checks ensure that the downstream service is
accessible and ready to accept data. This check is performed
upon sink initialization. If the health check fails an error
will be logged and Vector will proceed to start.

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Vector uses [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) for TLS protocols due to OpenSSL's maturity. You can
enable and adjust TLS behavior using the [`tls.*`](#tls) options.
