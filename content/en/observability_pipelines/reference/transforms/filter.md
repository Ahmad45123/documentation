title: Filter

Filters events based on a set of conditions.

# Configuration
<table><thead><tr><td>Param</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>condition</td><td>The condition that every input event is matched against.

If an event is matched by the condition, it is forwarded. Otherwise, the event is dropped.</td></tr><tr><td>inputs</td><td>A list of upstream [source][sources] or [transform][transforms] IDs.

Wildcards (`*`) are supported.

See [configuration][configuration] for more info.

[sources]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sources/
[transforms]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/transforms/
[configuration]: https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>The component type. This is a required field for all components and tells Vector which component to use.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# Output Data

# Telemetry
<table></tbody><tr><td>events_discarded_total</td><td>The total number of events discarded by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>events_in_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.
This metric is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use [`component_received_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_received_events_total) instead.</td></tr><tr><td>events_out_total</td><td>The total number of events emitted by this component.
This metric is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use [`component_sent_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_sent_events_total) instead.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_events_count</td><td>A histogram of the number of events passed in each internal batch in Vector's internal topology.

Note that this is separate than sink-level batching. It is mostly useful for low level debugging
performance issues in Vector due to small internal batches.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_events_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of event bytes accepted by this component either from
tagged origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>utilization</td><td>A ratio from 0 to 1 of the load on a component. A value of 0 would indicate a completely idle component that is simply waiting for input. A value of 1 would indicate a that is never idle. This value is updated every 5 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>component_sent_events_total</td><td>The total number of events emitted by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>processed_events_total</td><td>The total number of events processed by this component.
This metric is deprecated in place of using
[`component_received_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_received_events_total) and
[`component_sent_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_sent_events_total) metrics.</td></tr><tr><td>component_sent_event_bytes_total</td><td>The total number of event bytes emitted by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>processed_bytes_total</td><td>The number of bytes processed by the component.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# How It Works
## State
This component is stateless, meaning its behavior is consistent across each input.
