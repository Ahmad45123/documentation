title: Throttle
---
Rate limits one or more log streams to limit load on downstream services, or to enforce usage quotas on users.

# Configuration
<table><thead><tr><td>Param</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>exclude</td><td>A logical condition used to exclude events from sampling.</td></tr><tr><td>key_field</td><td>The name of the log field whose value will be hashed to determine if the event should be
rate limited.

Each unique key will create a bucket of related events to be rate limited separately. If
left unspecified, or if the event doesnâ€™t have `key_field`, the event be will not be rate
limited separately.</td></tr><tr><td>threshold</td><td>The number of events allowed for a given bucket per configured `window_secs`.

Each unique key will have its own `threshold`.</td></tr><tr><td>inputs</td><td>A list of upstream [source][sources] or [transform][transforms] IDs.

Wildcards (`*`) are supported.

See [configuration][configuration] for more info.

This is a required field for all components and tells Vector which component to use.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# Output Data

# Telemetry
<table></tbody><tr><td>events_discarded_total</td><td>The total number of events discarded by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>events_in_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.
This metric is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use [`component_received_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_received_events_total) instead.</td></tr><tr><td>events_out_total</td><td>The total number of events emitted by this component.
This metric is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use [`component_sent_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_sent_events_total) instead.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_events_count</td><td>A histogram of the number of events passed in each internal batch in Vector's internal topology.

Note that this is separate than sink-level batching. It is mostly useful for low level debugging
performance issues in Vector due to small internal batches.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_events_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of event bytes accepted by this component either from
tagged origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>utilization</td><td>A ratio from 0 to 1 of the load on a component. A value of 0 would indicate a completely idle component that is simply waiting for input. A value of 1 would indicate a that is never idle. This value is updated every 5 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>component_sent_events_total</td><td>The total number of events emitted by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>processed_events_total</td><td>The total number of events processed by this component.
This metric is deprecated in place of using
[`component_received_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_received_events_total) and
[`component_sent_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_sent_events_total) metrics.</td></tr><tr><td>component_sent_event_bytes_total</td><td>The total number of event bytes emitted by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>processed_bytes_total</td><td>The number of bytes processed by the component.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# How It Works
## Rate Limiting
The `throttle` transform will spread load across the configured `window_secs`, ensuring that each bucket's
throughput averages out to the `threshold` per `window_secs`. It utilizes a [Generic Cell Rate Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_cell_rate_algorithm) to
rate limit the event stream.

## State
This component is stateful, meaning its behavior changes based on previous inputs (events).
State is not preserved across restarts, therefore state-dependent behavior will reset between
restarts and depend on the inputs (events) received since the most recent restart.
