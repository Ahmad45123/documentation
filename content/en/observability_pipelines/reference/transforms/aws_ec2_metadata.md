title: AWS EC2 Metadata
---
Enriches events with AWS EC2 environment metadata.

# Configuration
<table><thead><tr><td>Param</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>endpoint</td><td>Overrides the default EC2 metadata endpoint.</td></tr><tr><td>fields</td><td>A list of metadata fields to include in each transformed event.</td></tr><tr><td>namespace</td><td>Sets a prefix for all event fields added by the transform.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy</td><td>Proxy configuration.

Configure to proxy traffic through an HTTP(S) proxy when making external requests.

Similar to common proxy configuration convention, users can set different proxies
to use based on the type of traffic being proxied, as well as set specific hosts that
should not be proxied.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy.enabled</td><td>Enables proxying support.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy.http</td><td>Proxy endpoint to use when proxying HTTP traffic.

Must be a valid URI string.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy.https</td><td>Proxy endpoint to use when proxying HTTPS traffic.

Must be a valid URI string.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy.no_proxy</td><td>A list of hosts to avoid proxying.

Multiple patterns are allowed:

| Pattern             | Example match                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain names        | `example.com` matches requests to `example.com`                     |
| Wildcard domains    | `.example.com` matches requests to `example.com` and its subdomains |
| IP addresses        | `127.0.0.1` matches requests to `127.0.0.1`                         |
| [CIDR][cidr] blocks | `192.168.0.0/16` matches requests to any IP addresses in this range     |
| Splat               | `*` matches all hosts                                                   |

[cidr]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing</td></tr><tr><td>refresh_interval_secs</td><td>The interval between querying for updated metadata, in seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>refresh_timeout_secs</td><td>The timeout for querying the EC2 metadata endpoint, in seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>required</td><td>Requires the transform to be able to successfully query the EC2 metadata before starting to process the data.</td></tr><tr><td>inputs</td><td>A list of upstream [source][sources] or [transform][transforms] IDs.

Wildcards (`*`) are supported.

This is a required field for all components and tells Vector which component to use.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# Output Data

# Telemetry
<table></tbody><tr><td>metadata_refresh_failed_total</td><td>The total number of failed efforts to refresh AWS EC2 metadata.</td></tr><tr><td>events_in_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.
This metric is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use [`component_received_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_received_events_total) instead.</td></tr><tr><td>events_out_total</td><td>The total number of events emitted by this component.
This metric is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use [`component_sent_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_sent_events_total) instead.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_events_count</td><td>A histogram of the number of events passed in each internal batch in Vector's internal topology.

Note that this is separate than sink-level batching. It is mostly useful for low level debugging
performance issues in Vector due to small internal batches.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_events_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of event bytes accepted by this component either from
tagged origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>utilization</td><td>A ratio from 0 to 1 of the load on a component. A value of 0 would indicate a completely idle component that is simply waiting for input. A value of 1 would indicate a that is never idle. This value is updated every 5 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>component_sent_events_total</td><td>The total number of events emitted by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>processed_events_total</td><td>The total number of events processed by this component.
This metric is deprecated in place of using
[`component_received_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_received_events_total) and
[`component_sent_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_sent_events_total) metrics.</td></tr><tr><td>metadata_refresh_successful_total</td><td>The total number of AWS EC2 metadata refreshes.</td></tr><tr><td>component_sent_event_bytes_total</td><td>The total number of event bytes emitted by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>processed_bytes_total</td><td>The number of bytes processed by the component.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# How It Works
## State
This component is stateless, meaning its behavior is consistent across each input.
