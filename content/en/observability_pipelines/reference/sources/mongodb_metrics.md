# Configuration
<table><thead><tr><td>Param</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>endpoints</td><td>A list of MongoDB instances to scrape.

Each endpoint must be in the [Connection String URI Format](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/).</td></tr><tr><td>namespace</td><td>Overrides the default namespace for the metrics emitted by the source.

If set to an empty string, no namespace is added to the metrics.

By default, `mongodb` is used.</td></tr><tr><td>scrape_interval_secs</td><td>The interval between scrapes, in seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>The component type. This is a required field for all components and tells Vector which component to use.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# Output Data

# Telemetry
<table></tbody><tr><td>events_in_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.
This metric is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use [`component_received_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_received_events_total) instead.</td></tr><tr><td>collect_completed_total</td><td>The total number of metrics collections completed for this component.</td></tr><tr><td>collect_duration_seconds</td><td>The duration spent collecting of metrics for this component.</td></tr><tr><td>events_out_total</td><td>The total number of events emitted by this component.
This metric is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Use [`component_sent_events_total`](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#component_sent_events_total) instead.</td></tr><tr><td>component_sent_events_total</td><td>The total number of events emitted by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>component_sent_event_bytes_total</td><td>The total number of event bytes emitted by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>request_errors_total</td><td>The total number of requests errors for this component.</td></tr><tr><td>parse_errors_total</td><td>The total number of errors parsing metrics for this component.</td></tr><tr><td>component_discarded_events_total</td><td>The number of events dropped by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>component_errors_total</td><td>The total number of errors encountered by this component.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_bytes_total</td><td>The number of deserialized bytes from the returned BSON documents</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_event_bytes_total</td><td>The number of event bytes accepted by this component either from
tagged origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>component_received_events_total</td><td>The number of events accepted by this component either from tagged
origins like file and uri, or cumulatively from other origins.</td></tr><tr><td>source_lag_time_seconds</td><td>The difference between the timestamp recorded in each event and the time when it was ingested, expressed as fractional seconds.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# How It Works
## MongoDB `serverStatus` command
The [serverStatus](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/serverStatus/) command
returns a document that provides an overview of the databaseâ€™s
state. The output fields vary depending on the version of
MongoDB, underlying operating system platform, the storage
engine, and the kind of node, including `mongos`, `mongod` or
`replica set` member.

## State
This component is stateless, meaning its behavior is consistent across each input.

## Context
By default, the `mongodb_metrics` source augments events with helpful
context keys.
