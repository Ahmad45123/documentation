# Configuration
<table><thead><tr><td>Param</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>acknowledgements</td><td>Controls how acknowledgements are handled by this source.

This setting is **deprecated** in favor of enabling `acknowledgements` at the [global][global_acks] or sink level.

Enabling or disabling acknowledgements at the source level has **no effect** on acknowledgement behavior.

See [End-to-end Acknowledgements][e2e_acks] for more information on how event acknowledgement is handled.

[e2e_acks]: https://vector.dev/docs/about/under-the-hood/architecture/end-to-end-acknowledgements/</td></tr><tr><td>acknowledgements.enabled</td><td>Whether or not end-to-end acknowledgements are enabled for this source.</td></tr><tr><td>address</td><td>The socket address to listen for connections on.

It _must_ include a port.</td></tr><tr><td>auth</td><td>HTTP Basic authentication configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.password</td><td>The password for basic authentication.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.username</td><td>The username for basic authentication.</td></tr><tr><td>decoding</td><td>Configures how events are decoded from raw bytes.</td></tr><tr><td>decoding.codec</td><td>The codec to use for decoding events.</td></tr><tr><td>encoding</td><td>The expected encoding of received data.

Note that for `json` and `ndjson` encodings, the fields of the JSON objects are output as separate fields.</td></tr><tr><td>framing</td><td>Framing configuration.

Framing deals with how events are separated when encoded in a raw byte form, where each event is
a "frame" that must be prefixed, or delimited, in a way that marks where an event begins and
ends within the byte stream.</td></tr><tr><td>framing.character_delimited</td><td>Options for the character delimited decoder.</td></tr><tr><td>framing.character_delimited.delimiter</td><td>The character that delimits byte sequences.</td></tr><tr><td>framing.character_delimited.max_length</td><td>The maximum length of the byte buffer.

This length does *not* include the trailing delimiter.

By default, there is no maximum length enforced. If events are malformed, this can lead to
additional resource usage as events continue to be buffered in memory, and can potentially
lead to memory exhaustion in extreme cases.

If there is a risk of processing malformed data, such as logs with user-controlled input,
consider setting the maximum length to a reasonably large value as a safety net. This will
ensure that processing is not truly unbounded.</td></tr><tr><td>framing.method</td><td>The framing method.</td></tr><tr><td>framing.newline_delimited</td><td>Options for the newline delimited decoder.</td></tr><tr><td>framing.newline_delimited.max_length</td><td>The maximum length of the byte buffer.

This length does *not* include the trailing delimiter.

By default, there is no maximum length enforced. If events are malformed, this can lead to
additional resource usage as events continue to be buffered in memory, and can potentially
lead to memory exhaustion in extreme cases.

If there is a risk of processing malformed data, such as logs with user-controlled input,

These will override any values included in the JSON payload with conflicting names.</td></tr><tr><td>method</td><td>Specifies the action of the HTTP request.</td></tr><tr><td>path</td><td>The URL path on which log event POST requests shall be sent.</td></tr><tr><td>path_key</td><td>The event key in which the requested URL path used to send the request will be stored.</td></tr><tr><td>query_parameters</td><td>A list of URL query parameters to include in the log event.

These will override any values included in the body with conflicting names.</td></tr><tr><td>strict_path</td><td>Whether or not to treat the configured `path` as an absolute path.

If set to `true`, only requests using the exact URL path specified in `path` will be accepted. Otherwise,
requests sent to a URL path that starts with the value of `path` will be accepted.

With `strict_path` set to `false` and `path` set to `""`, the configured HTTP source will accept requests from
any URL path.</td></tr><tr><td>tls</td><td>Configures the TLS options for incoming/outgoing connections.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.alpn_protocols</td><td>Sets the list of supported ALPN protocols.

Declare the supported ALPN protocols, which are used during negotiation with peer. Prioritized in the order
they are defined.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.ca_file</td><td>Absolute path to an additional CA certificate file.

The certificate must be in the DER or PEM (X.509) format. Additionally, the certificate can be provided as an inline string in PEM format.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.crt_file</td><td>Absolute path to a certificate file used to identify this server.

The certificate must be in DER, PEM (X.509), or PKCS#12 format. Additionally, the certificate can be provided as
an inline string in PEM format.

If this is set, and is not a PKCS#12 archive, `key_file` must also be set.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.enabled</td><td>Whether or not to require TLS for incoming/outgoing connections.

When enabled and used for incoming connections, an identity certificate is also required. See `tls.crt_file` for
more information.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.key_file</td><td>Absolute path to a private key file used to identify this server.

The key must be in DER or PEM (PKCS#8) format. Additionally, the key can be provided as an inline string in PEM format.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.key_pass</td><td>Passphrase used to unlock the encrypted key file.

This has no effect unless `key_file` is set.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.verify_certificate</td><td>Enables certificate verification.

If enabled, certificates must be valid in terms of not being expired, as well as being issued by a trusted
issuer. This verification operates in a hierarchical manner, checking that not only the leaf certificate (the
certificate presented by the client/server) is valid, but also that the issuer of that certificate is valid, and
so on until reaching a root certificate.

Relevant for both incoming and outgoing connections.

Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the validity of certificates.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.verify_hostname</td><td>Enables hostname verification.

If enabled, the hostname used to connect to the remote host must be present in the TLS certificate presented by
the remote host, either as the Common Name or as an entry in the Subject Alternative Name extension.

Only relevant for outgoing connections.

Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the remote hostname.</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>The component type. This is a required field for all components and tells Vector which component to use.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# How It Works
## Decompression
Received body is decompressed according to `Content-Encoding` header.
Supported algorithms are `gzip`, `deflate`, `snappy`, and `zstd`.

## State
This component is stateless, meaning its behavior is consistent across each input.

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Vector uses [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) for TLS protocols. You can
adjust TLS behavior via the `tls.*` options.

## Context
By default, the `http_server` source augments events with helpful
context keys.
