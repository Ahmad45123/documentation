# Configuration
<table><thead><tr><td>Param</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>acknowledgements</td><td>Controls how acknowledgements are handled by this source.

This setting is **deprecated** in favor of enabling `acknowledgements` at the [global][global_acks] or sink level.

Enabling or disabling acknowledgements at the source level has **no effect** on acknowledgement behavior.

See [End-to-end Acknowledgements][e2e_acks] for more information on how event acknowledgement is handled.

It _must_ include a port.</td></tr><tr><td>grpc.tls</td><td>Configures the TLS options for incoming/outgoing connections.</td></tr><tr><td>grpc.tls.alpn_protocols</td><td>Sets the list of supported ALPN protocols.

Declare the supported ALPN protocols, which are used during negotiation with peer. Prioritized in the order
they are defined.</td></tr><tr><td>grpc.tls.ca_file</td><td>Absolute path to an additional CA certificate file.

The certificate must be in the DER or PEM (X.509) format. Additionally, the certificate can be provided as an inline string in PEM format.</td></tr><tr><td>grpc.tls.crt_file</td><td>Absolute path to a certificate file used to identify this server.

The certificate must be in DER, PEM (X.509), or PKCS#12 format. Additionally, the certificate can be provided as
an inline string in PEM format.

If this is set, and is not a PKCS#12 archive, `key_file` must also be set.</td></tr><tr><td>grpc.tls.enabled</td><td>Whether or not to require TLS for incoming/outgoing connections.

When enabled and used for incoming connections, an identity certificate is also required. See `tls.crt_file` for
more information.</td></tr><tr><td>grpc.tls.key_file</td><td>Absolute path to a private key file used to identify this server.

The key must be in DER or PEM (PKCS#8) format. Additionally, the key can be provided as an inline string in PEM format.</td></tr><tr><td>grpc.tls.key_pass</td><td>Passphrase used to unlock the encrypted key file.

This has no effect unless `key_file` is set.</td></tr><tr><td>grpc.tls.verify_certificate</td><td>Enables certificate verification.

If enabled, certificates must be valid in terms of not being expired, as well as being issued by a trusted
issuer. This verification operates in a hierarchical manner, checking that not only the leaf certificate (the
certificate presented by the client/server) is valid, but also that the issuer of that certificate is valid, and
so on until reaching a root certificate.

Relevant for both incoming and outgoing connections.

Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the validity of certificates.</td></tr><tr><td>grpc.tls.verify_hostname</td><td>Enables hostname verification.

If enabled, the hostname used to connect to the remote host must be present in the TLS certificate presented by
the remote host, either as the Common Name or as an entry in the Subject Alternative Name extension.

Only relevant for outgoing connections.

Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the remote hostname.</td></tr><tr><td>http</td><td>Configuration for the `opentelemetry` HTTP server.</td></tr><tr><td>http.address</td><td>The socket address to listen for connections on.

# How It Works
## Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Vector uses [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) for TLS protocols. You can
adjust TLS behavior via the `grpc.tls.*` and `http.tls.*` options.

## State
This component is stateless, meaning its behavior is consistent across each input.

## Context
By default, the `opentelemetry` source augments events with helpful
context keys.
