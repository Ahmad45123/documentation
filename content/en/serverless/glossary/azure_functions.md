### General serverless concepts

| Concept                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Serverless          | Serverless is a model that involves a cloud provider allocating backend resources on-demand. This paradigm enables you to build, run, and deploy applications and services without having to manage infrastructure.                              |
| Function          | In a serverless paradigm, a function is a self-contained application.                                 |
| Cloud-based development          | A workflow where developers run their code in the cloud during the development process, instead of just on their local machines. Generally, building serverless applications requires cloud-based development.                                |
| Cold start          | The first time you invoke a cloud function, it may take a longer time to complete than subsequent invocations. This phenomenon is called a cold start, and may be caused by factors such as the cloud provider needing time to provision underlying resources.                                 |
| Event-driven architecture          | An architectural pattern whereby events are used to communicate between decoupled services.                                 |
| FaaS          | Function-as-a-Service is a mechanism for running custom code in the cloud without first needing to provision a dedicated server to host the code. Implementations of FaaS include AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions and Microsoft Azure Functions.                                |
| Per usage pricing         | Per usage pricing is when a cloud customer is charged based on how many times they used a specific service and not based on a fixed time period                              |

### Azure Functions concepts

| Concept                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure Functions          | Microsoft's FaaS offering.                          |
| Azure App Service          | A group of serverless resources that enable you to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, event-driven functions, and RESTful APIs without managing infrastructure.                               |
| Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template)          | A JSON file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax. In declarative syntax, you describe your intended deployment without writing the sequence of programming commands to create the deployment.                         |
