Your tests appear in the [Tests][1] page under the CI menu in Datadog.

Each test execution is reported as a trace, which in the case of integration tests includes calls made to datastores or third party services using regular [APM instrumentation][2]. You can list, filter, and get individual test execution traces in the [Test Runs][3] tab. You can also interactively plot graphs and top lists using the [Analytics][4] tab.

Test execution data is also available in [Dashboards][5] and [Notebooks][6]. The Tests page shows the _Branches_ list and the _Test Services_ list.

### Branches list

The [Branches][7] tab lists all branches from all Test Services that have reported test results. This tab is useful for individual developers to quickly see the status of their branches and troubleshoot test failures.

In this page, filter the list to show only your branches (branches that contain at least one commit authored by you) by enabling clicking **My branches** and adding the email addresses you use in your Git configuration.

Each branch and for its latest commit shows a consolidated number of tests broken down by status (which takes into account retries) and the number of new flaky tests introduced by the commit (a flaky test is defined as a test that both passes and fails on the same commit). There's also information about the wall time of the last execution, and a comparison to the average wall time of the default branch. Hovering over the commit author avatar shows detailed information about the commit.

Click on a branch to see a branch dashboard showing detailed information about failing, flaky, and slow tests.

### Test Services list

The [Test Services][8] shows the default branch of each test service. This tab is useful for teams to understand the overall health of the service over time.

This page shows the same information as the Branches list, but applied to the default branch. Click on a branch to see the default branch dashboard.

### How third-party services data is shown

Spans generated by third party services that are instrumented with APM and that are involved in integration tests appear in [APM][12]. You can filter spans that were generated as part of an integration test using the `Origin Service` facet and selecting the test service name used by the integration test.
