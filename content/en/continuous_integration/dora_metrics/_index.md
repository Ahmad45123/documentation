## Overview

DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics are [four key metrics][1] used to indicate the velocity and stability of software development.

Deployment Frequency
: How often an organization successfully releases to production.

Lead Time for Changes
: The amount of time it takes a commit to get into production.

Change Failure Rate
: The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production.

Time to Restore Service
: How long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in production.

Defining and tracking DORA metrics can help you identify areas of improvement for your team or organization's software delivery speed and quality.

## Set up DORA Metrics

Services tracked for DORA Metrics must be registered in the [Service Catalog][2]. See [Adding Entries to Service catalog][3].
The owner `team` from the catalog is automatically attached to all metrics.

### Deployment frequency

Submit a deployment with the [DORA Metrics API][5] or with the `datadog-ci dora deployment` command using the [`datadog-ci`][4] CLI tool.

You are required to provide the following deployment attributes:

- `service`
- `started_at`
- `finished_at`

You can optionally add the following deployment attributes:

- `repository_url` and `commit_sha` must both be present if you would like your deployment to be factored into [change lead time](#lead-time-for-changes).
- `env` to accurately filter your DORA metrics by environment.

#### Example

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "API - Curl" %}}

See the [API docs][1] for the full spec and more examples with the API SDKs.

```bash
  curl -X POST "https://api.{{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}/api/v2/dora/deployment" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "DD-API-KEY: ${DD_API_KEY}" \
  -d @- << EOF
  {
    "data": {
      "attributes": {
        "service": "shopist",
        "started_at": 1693491974000000000,
        "finished_at": 1693491984000000000,
        "git": {
          "commit_sha": "66adc9350f2cc9b250b69abddab733dd55e1a588",
          "repository_url": "https://github.com/organization/example-repository"
        },
        "env": "prod"
      }
    }
  }
EOF
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "datadog-ci CLI" %}}

The [`datadog-ci`][1] CLI tool provides a shortcut to send the deployments within CI.

```bash
export DD_BETA_COMMANDS_ENABLED=1
export DD_SITE={{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}
export DD_API_KEY="api-key"

export deploy_start=`date +%s`
./your-deploy-script.sh
datadog-ci dora deployment --service shopist --env prod \
    --started-at $deploy_start --finished-at `date +%s` \
    --git-repository-url "https://github.com/organization/example-repository" \
    --git-commit-sha 66adc9350f2cc9b250b69abddab733dd55e1a588
```

Optional parameters:
  - `finished-at` will be automatically set to now if not provided.
  - `env`
  - `git-repository-url` and `git-commit-sha` can be omitted if the deployment CI job is running on exactly the same git checkout that has been deployed.
  - `skip-git` disables the git details ([change lead time](#lead-time-for-changes) will not be available).

### Lead time for changes

Change lead time, or lead time for changes, is calculated as the time from creation of the first commit to when that commit's deployment is finished.

For change lead time to be available, you must send deployment events as described in [deployment frequency](#deployment-frequency) while your repository metadata is being synchronized to Datadog.

The deployment events must include the `repository_url` and `commit_sha` fields.

Change lead time automatically finds new commits included since the previous deployment. The first deployment sent for a service will not have change lead time.

</div>

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "GitHub" %}}

Install Datadog's [GitHub integration][1] on the [GitHub integration tile][2] to allow Datadog to synchronize your repository metadata automatically. When specifying permissions on the integration tile, select at least **Read** permissions for **Contents**.

{{% tab "Other Git Providers" %}}

You can upload your repository metadata with the [`datadog-ci git-metadata upload`][1] command.

When you run `datadog-ci git-metadata upload` within a Git repository, Datadog receives the repository URL, the commit SHA of the current branch, and a list of tracked file paths.

Run this command in cI for every new commit.

### Validation

To ensure the data is being collected, run `datadog-ci git-metadata upload` in your CI pipeline.

You can expect to see the following output:

```
Reporting commit 007f7f466e035b052415134600ea899693e7bb34 from repository git@github.com:organization/example-repository.git.
180 tracked file paths will be reported.
âœ…  Handled in 0.077 seconds.
```

### Change failure rate

Change failure rate is calculated as the percentage of incident events out of the total number of deployments.

Submit deployment events as described in [deployment frequency](#deployment-frequency).

Additionally submit an incident with the [DORA Metrics API][7].

You are required to provide the following incident attributes:

- `service`
- `started_at`

You can optionally add the following incident attributes:

- `finished_at` for *resolved incidents*. Required for [time to restore service](#time-to-restore-service).
- `name` to describe the incident
- `severity`
- `env` to accurately filter your DORA metrics by environment.
- `repository_url`
- `commit_sha`

See the [API docs][7] for the full spec and more examples with the API SDKs.

#### Example

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.{{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}/api/v2/dora/incident" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "DD-API-KEY: ${DD_API_KEY}" \
  -d @- << EOF
  {
    "data": {
      "attributes": {
        "service": "shopist",
        "started_at": 1693491974000000000,
        "finished_at": 1693491984000000000,
        "git": {
          "commit_sha": "66adc9350f2cc9b250b69abddab733dd55e1a588",
          "repository_url": "https://github.com/organization/example-repository"
        },
        "env": "prod",
        "name": "Web server is down failing all requests",
        "severity": "High"
      }
    }
  }
EOF
```

### Time to restore service

Mean time to restore (MTTR) is calculated as the duration distribution for *resolved incident* events.

*Resolved incidents* are incidents that include `finished_at`.

Follow the steps described in [change failure rate](#change-failure-rate) to send incident events.

Events can be sent both when started and after resolution. The incident is counted as the same incident if the `env`, `service` and `started_at` match.

## Limitations

- Deployment and incident events must be sent as soon as possible. Events older than 1 hour will be rejected.
- Deployments or incidents of the same service cannot happen at the same second.
- For [change lead time](#lead-time-for-changes) the retention of git metadata is 1 month. This means commits older that 1 month will not be accounted for.
