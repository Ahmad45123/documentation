## Overview
Cloud-based applications can generate massive amounts of data. And as your organization or business scales, you'll naturally have more teams that want and need to submit more data to provide better coverage of how your business is doing. But this growth can be daunting and seem unruly for organizations; especially for core observability teams within these organizations that are responsible for managing overall observability spend and resolving sudden spikes and overages quickly as to not burn through their budget. Observability costs are becoming a significant budget item but core observability teams lack visibility into what is truly valuable to each individual engineering team. Concurrently, individual teams may have limited insights into the costs of the metrics/tags they're submitting; therefore, they're less incentivized to be proactive in helping manage this growth. 

It is crucial for everyone to have visibility into their usage and feel empowered to take ownership of managing those volumes and associated costs. Therefore, we've introduced the Metrics Volume Management page to provide this comprehensive visibility and intelligent insights for which metrics you should focus your cost-optimization efforts with Metrics without Limits. Datadog recognizes that not all your metrics are equally valuable at every moment, so we were the first in the industry to introduce Datadog's Metrics without LimitsTM [link] which provides you flexibility by decoupling metric ingestion from indexing; allowing you to configure metrics to reduce costs through aggregation while preserving the mathematical accuracy of your configured metrics (all within our platform without any code-level changes). 

The Metrics Volume Management page [link] provides an out-of-the-box view of both your custom metrics' value, volume and therefore, costs in real-time so any developer in your organization can quickly identify the root causes of any volume spikes and be empowered to remediate those potentially inadvertent spikes with Metrics without Limits even faster without sacrificing the core observability that your teams' rely on. 

This volume management page provides all users real-time answers to the following questions: 
  - Which metric names are causing my custom metrics bill to spike? 
  - What are my organization's largest custom metrics?
  - Are these high cardinality custom metric names actually queried and valuable to my team? 
  - What metric names have spiked recently in the past timeframe of my choosing? (i.e. past day or month) 
  - I'm on `team:X` and responsible for optimizing my team's metrics based on internal chargebacks - which metrics do I own?
- I'm on `team:X` and responsible for optimizing my team's metrics based on internal chargebacks -  which ones should I focus my cost-optimization efforts on? 
  - How can my team better utilize our existing metrics to get more value from our observability spend?

## Identifying drivers of your account's custom metrics bill spikes 
As a quick refresher, your overall account's usage and monthly bill for custom metrics can viewed on the Plan&Usage page [link], such as your monthly Custom Metrics usage, costs, burn rate and Top Custom Metrics. The Usage Attribution feature [link] also provides a breakdown of your overall account's bill by any arbitrary dimension of your choosing; for example, `team:X` emits a volume of 10K custom metrics. However, as we stated earlier, all developers should have visibility into which metrics are driving their bill spikes in real-time and feel confident that their cost optimization efforts won't sacrifice another team's visibility. 

Therefore, the Metrics Volume Management page provides _all_ users (not just ones with Admin roles) with real-time, OOTB insights such as: 
- Top 500 Metric Names by Estimated Real-time Cardinality -- Quickly identify the top 500 metric names by cardinality/volume by clicking on the "Est. Custom Metrics" 
- Top 500 Metric Names by Change in Volume -- Quickly discover the top 500 metric names that have the greatest variance in their cardinality -- these metrics may have anomalously (potentially unintentionally) spiked in the timeframe of your choosing. If you've received an alert on your account's estimated real-time custom metrics usage, you can use this to quickly pinpoint the culprits tied to that spike. 

To view how your spiking metric's cardinality has changed over time: 
{{< img src="metrics/volume/hoverstate.jpg" alt="Change in Volume Hover Graph" style="width:75%;">}}
1. Select a timeframe of your choosing in the top right hand corner (recommended timeframe of Past 1 Day or Past 4 Weeks) 
2. Click on the `Change in Volume` label to open up a comparison graph of your spiking metric's cardinality over time as well as how much percentage wise your metric has spiked
3. (Optional) Create a change % metric monitor to proactively alert on this spiking metric. Learn more about change monitors here[link: https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/guide/change-alert/] 

You can additionally filter this list of spiking metric names down to the metrics submitted by a specific team, application or service to view who is responsible for any potential volume spikes. To do so, type in any tag key value pair in the *Filter by Tag Value* box.
{{< img src="metrics/volume/teamfilter.jpg" alt="Metrics Volume Management page filtered to team:dbm" style="width:75%;">}}

## Understanding whether these metrics provide value to your organization 
Now that you've identified your largest metrics or spiking metric names likely causing your account's overall custom metric volume spike, you'll need to understand the utility of this data in order to safely use Metrics without Limits to effectively reduce the costs of those metric names. 

To identify your top metric names that haven't been actively queried in the past 30 days, click on "Not Actively Queried" in the Query Activity Facet box on the left. Datadog analyzes your query patterns over the past 30 days to intelligently identify which metrics are valuable to your teams vs not. Selecting "Not Actively Queried" returns a list of metric names that haven't been actively queried on any dashboards, notebooks, monitors, SLOs, Metrics Explorer or via the API. We continuously analyze your query patterns such that you can always access an updated list in a matter of seconds. 

### Quickly reduce costs of your unqueried metrics
Now that you've identified which metric names aren't valuable due to their querry patterns, you can quickly eliminate the volumes, and therefore costs, of these metric names by using Metrics without Limits[link] to maximize efficiency and ROI on your observability spend. 

1. Click on the metric name to open its details sidepanel
2. Click the Manage Tags button to open the tag configuration modal.
3. Select Include tags… but set an empty allowlist of tags.

## Facet panel

The search bars provide the most comprehensive set of actions to filter the list of metrics. But facets can also filter your metrics by:

- **Configuration**: Metrics with tag configurations
- **Percentiles**: Distribution metrics enabled by percentiles/advanced query capabilities
- **Historical Metrics**: Metrics that have historical metrics ingestion enabled 
- **Query Activity** (Beta): Metrics not queried in the app or by the API in the past 30 days
- **Metric Type**: Differentiate between distribution and non-distribution metrics (counts, gauges, rates)
- **Distribution Metric Origin**: The product from which the metric originated (for example, metrics generated from Logs or APM Spans)

{{< img src="metrics/summary/facets3.jpg" alt="Metrics Facet Panel" style="width:75%;">}}


## Configuration of multiple metrics 
There are two buttons that allow you to configure multiple metrics at a time: 

{{< img src="metrics/summary/configurationbuttons2.png" alt="Bulk Configuration Buttons" style="width:75%;">}}

* **Calculate Percentiles**: Add percentile aggregations to multiple distribution metrics.

{{< img src="metrics/summary/bulkpercentiles.jpg" alt="Bulk Percentiles" style="width:75%;">}}

* **Configure Tags**: Configure tags on multiple custom metrics matching a namespace using Metrics without Limits™

{{< img src="metrics/summary/bulkconfig_new-compressed.mp4" alt="Bulk Metric Tag Configuration" video="true" style="width:100%;" >}}


## Metric details sidepanel

Click on any metric name to display its details sidepanel for more information regarding the metric's metadata and tags: 

{{< img src="metrics/summary/mwl_sidepanel.jpg" alt="Metric panel" style="width:75%;">}}

### Metric name

The name of your metric in the [Metrics Explorer][2], [dashboards][3], etc.

### Ingested custom metrics

A metric name may emit multiple ingested custom metrics depending on its associated tag value combinations. Ingested custom metrics represent all of the data originally submitted with code.

Learn more in the [custom metrics][4] documentation.

### Indexed custom metrics

Unlike ingested custom metrics, indexed custom metrics represent those that remain queryable across the Datadog platform. This number may be impacted by adding or removing percentile aggregations or by use of Metrics without Limits™. Learn more in the [Metrics without Limits™][10] documentation.

### Hosts

The total number of hosts reporting a metric.

### Tag values

The total number of unique tag values attached to a metric.

[Learn more about tagging][5].

### Metrics metadata

The metadata attached to your metric. Most of the metadata can be edited on the metric summary page or with the [Datadog API][6].

#### Metric unit

The unit for your metric (byte, second, request, query, etc.). See the [metric unit][7] page for more details.

When submitting custom metrics to Datadog, it is possible to change the [unit of measurement][1] that displays when hovering over the metric in your graph.

**Note**: This does not change how a metric graph is displayed. It only changes the units of measurement that raw values are considered as when you hover over a metric. Formatting is automatically applied for readability. For example, bytes (`B`) may be displayed as kilobytes (`KiB`).

#### Metric type

The type for your metric (gauge, rate, count, distribution). See the [metric type][8] page for more details.

**Warning**: Editing the metric type changes that metric's behavior for **ALL** your dashboards and monitors.

#### Integration name

If the metric is coming from a supported [integration][9], the metadata lists the integration name. This information cannot be edited.

#### Interval

The collection interval for the metric in seconds.

#### Metric description

The metric description helps you understand what a metric does. Descriptions are pre-populated for metrics coming from supported [integrations][9]. Use this field to update the descriptions for your [custom metrics][4].

### Tags table

The tags table offers multiple ways to explore all of the tag keys and tag values that are actively reporting in your metric's data.

Use the tags table to:

- Sort tag keys by the **Count column** (count of unique tag values).
- Search through the paginated table of tags for a particular tag key.
- Export the tags table as a downloadable CSV.
- Toggle between tags you've configured on your metric vs the metric's originally submitted tags

For any particular tag key, you can:

- Inspect all tag values of that tag key.
- Use a specific tag `key:value` to further filter the list of metrics displayed on the Metrics Summary page.
- Open a graph of this metric filtered by your tag `key:value` pair in the Metrics Explorer.
- Copy any tag `key:value` for filtering across the application.

## Metrics without Limits™
Metrics without Limits™ provides you control over the size of your custom metrics without requiring any agent or code-level changes. 

**Note:** Metrics without Limits™ is only available for custom metrics.

You can configure tags using the bulk metric tag configuration button or the **Manage Tags** button in a metric's details side panel. 

{{< img src="metrics/distributions/managetags.png" alt="Configuring tags on a distribution" style="width:80%;">}}

1. Click on your custom distribution metric name in the **Metrics Summary** table to open the metrics details side panel.
2. Click the **Manage Tags** button to open the tag configuration modal.

3. Select **Include tags...** or **Exclude tags...** to customize the tags you do or don't want to query for. For more information on tag configuration, see the [Metrics without Limits][10] documentation.
4. Preview the effects of your proposed tag configuration with the cardinality estimator before selecting **Save**.

**Note**: The cardinality estimator requires the metric to be older than 48 hours.

### Queryable tags 

Once your metric has been configured with Metrics without Limits™, you can view which tags remain Queryable -- ultimately those that contribute to _Indexed Custom Metrics_ volume. And you can toggle back to all originally submitted and ingested tags that contribute to your _Ingested Custom Metrics_ volume. 

### Optimize your metric with aggregations in Advanced Mode

For custom metrics of the count, gauge, or rate metric type, you can further refine your metric's configurations by optionally including additional aggregations with the advanced mode of Metrics without Limits™. By default, Datadog stores the most frequently queried aggregation combination depending on the metric's type to preserve the mathematical accuracy of your configured metric's query as listed below: 

- Configured counts/rates are queryable with time/space aggregations of `SUM`
- Configured gauges are queryable in time/space aggregations of `AVG`

{{< img src="metrics/summary/customize_aggr_docs.jpg" alt="Refine aggregations on counts, rates, and gauges" style="width:80%;">}}

More aggregations are available should they be valuable to you. You can add or remove aggregations at any time with no required Agent or code-level changes.

**Note**: Configuring your count, rate, or gauge metric and removing an aggregation may impact existing dashboards and monitors.
