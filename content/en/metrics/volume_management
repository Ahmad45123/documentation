## Overview
Cloud-based applications can generate massive amounts of data. And as your organization or business scales, you'll naturally have more teams that want and need to submit more data to provide better coverage of how your business is doing. But this growth can be daunting and uncontrollable for organizations; especially core observability teams within these organizations that are responsible for managing their organization's overall observability spend and responsible for resolving sudden spikes and overages to not burn through their budget. Observability costs are becoming a significant budget item but the core observability team does not have visibility into what is truly valuable to each individual engineering team. Meanwhile, even though the teams creating the data are promoting a culture of deep observability, they have limited insights into the costs of the metrics/tags they're submitting; therefore, they're less incentivized to be proactive in controlling this growth.

It is crucial for everyone to have visibility into their usage and feel empowered to take ownership of managing those volumes and associated costs. Datadog recognizes that not all your metrics are equally valuable at every moment, so we were the first in the industry to introduce Datadog's Metrics without LimitsTM [link] which provides you flexibility by decoupling metric ingestion from indexing; allowing you to configure metrics to reduce costs through aggregation while preserving the mathematical accuracy of your configured metrics (all within our platform without any code-level changes). But it is also critical to balance the use of Metrics without Limits to reduce costs of metrics with understanding of value those metrics may bring to your organization. 

Datadog's Metrics Volume Management page [link] (beta banner here)  provides an out-of-the-box view of both your custom metrics' value, volume and therefore, costs in real-time so any developer in your organization can quickly identify the root causes of any volume spikes, which impact your bill, and be empowered to remediate those potentially inadvertent spikes faster without sacrificing the core observability that your teams' rely on. 

This volume management page provides all users real-time answers to the following questions: 
  - Which metric names are causing my custom metrics bill to spike? 
  - What are my organization's largest custom metrics?
  - Are these high cardinality custom metric names actually queried and valuable to my team? 
  - What metric names have spiked recently in the past timeframe of my choosing? (i.e. past day or month) 
  - I'm on `team:X` and responsible for optimizing my team's metrics based on internal chargebacks - which metrics do I own? 
- I'm on `team:X` and responsible for optimizing my team's metrics based on internal chargebacks -  which ones should I focus my cost-optimization efforts on? 
  - How can my team better utilize our existing metrics to get more value from our observability spend?

## Identifying drivers of your account's custom metrics bill spikes 
As a quick refresher, insights on your overall account's usage and monthly bill for custom metrics can viewed on the Plan&Usage page [link], such as your monthly Custom Metrics usage, costs, burn rate and Top Custom Metrics. The Usage Attribution feature [] also provides a breakdown of your overall account's bill by any arbitrary dimension of your choosing; for example, team:X emits a volume of 10K custom metrics. However, as we stated earlier, all developers should have visibility into which metrics are driving their bill spikes in real-time and feel confident that their cost optimization efforts won't sacrifice another team's visibility. 

Therefore, the Metrics Volume Management page provides all users (not just ones with Admin roles) with real-time, OOTB insights such as: 
- Top 500 Metric Names by Estimated Real-time Cardinality -- Quickly identify the top 500 metric names by cardinality/volume by clicking on the "Est. Custom Metrics" 
- Top 500 Metric Names by Change in Volume -- Quickly discover the top 500 metric names that have the greatest variance in their cardinality -- these metrics may have anomalously (potentially unintentionally) spiked in the timeframe of your choosing. If you've received an alert on your account's estimated real-time custom metrics usage, you can use this to quickly pinpoint the culprits tied to that spike. 

## Understanding whether these metrics provide value to your organization 
Now that you've identified your largest metrics or spiking metric names likely causing your account's custom metric spike, you'll need to understand the utility of this data in order to safely use Metrics without Limits to effectively reduce the costs of those metric names.

## Facet panel

The search bars provide the most comprehensive set of actions to filter the list of metrics. But facets can also filter your metrics by:

- **Configuration**: Metrics with tag configurations
- **Percentiles**: Distribution metrics enabled by percentiles/advanced query capabilities
- **Historical Metrics**: Metrics that have historical metrics ingestion enabled 
- **Query Activity** (Beta): Metrics not queried in the app or by the API in the past 30 days
- **Metric Type**: Differentiate between distribution and non-distribution metrics (counts, gauges, rates)
- **Distribution Metric Origin**: The product from which the metric originated (for example, metrics generated from Logs or APM Spans)

{{< img src="metrics/summary/facets3.jpg" alt="Metrics Facet Panel" style="width:75%;">}}


## Configuration of multiple metrics 
There are two buttons that allow you to configure multiple metrics at a time: 

{{< img src="metrics/summary/configurationbuttons2.png" alt="Bulk Configuration Buttons" style="width:75%;">}}

* **Calculate Percentiles**: Add percentile aggregations to multiple distribution metrics.

{{< img src="metrics/summary/bulkpercentiles.jpg" alt="Bulk Percentiles" style="width:75%;">}}

* **Configure Tags**: Configure tags on multiple custom metrics matching a namespace using Metrics without Limits™

{{< img src="metrics/summary/bulkconfig_new-compressed.mp4" alt="Bulk Metric Tag Configuration" video="true" style="width:100%;" >}}


## Metric details sidepanel

Click on any metric name to display its details sidepanel for more information regarding the metric's metadata and tags: 

{{< img src="metrics/summary/mwl_sidepanel.jpg" alt="Metric panel" style="width:75%;">}}

### Metric name

The name of your metric in the [Metrics Explorer][2], [dashboards][3], etc.

### Ingested custom metrics

A metric name may emit multiple ingested custom metrics depending on its associated tag value combinations. Ingested custom metrics represent all of the data originally submitted with code.

Learn more in the [custom metrics][4] documentation.

### Indexed custom metrics

Unlike ingested custom metrics, indexed custom metrics represent those that remain queryable across the Datadog platform. This number may be impacted by adding or removing percentile aggregations or by use of Metrics without Limits™. Learn more in the [Metrics without Limits™][10] documentation.

### Hosts

The total number of hosts reporting a metric.

### Tag values

The total number of unique tag values attached to a metric.

[Learn more about tagging][5].

### Metrics metadata

The metadata attached to your metric. Most of the metadata can be edited on the metric summary page or with the [Datadog API][6].

#### Metric unit

The unit for your metric (byte, second, request, query, etc.). See the [metric unit][7] page for more details.

When submitting custom metrics to Datadog, it is possible to change the [unit of measurement][1] that displays when hovering over the metric in your graph.

**Note**: This does not change how a metric graph is displayed. It only changes the units of measurement that raw values are considered as when you hover over a metric. Formatting is automatically applied for readability. For example, bytes (`B`) may be displayed as kilobytes (`KiB`).

#### Metric type

The type for your metric (gauge, rate, count, distribution). See the [metric type][8] page for more details.

**Warning**: Editing the metric type changes that metric's behavior for **ALL** your dashboards and monitors.

#### Integration name

If the metric is coming from a supported [integration][9], the metadata lists the integration name. This information cannot be edited.

#### Interval

The collection interval for the metric in seconds.

#### Metric description

The metric description helps you understand what a metric does. Descriptions are pre-populated for metrics coming from supported [integrations][9]. Use this field to update the descriptions for your [custom metrics][4].

### Tags table

The tags table offers multiple ways to explore all of the tag keys and tag values that are actively reporting in your metric's data.

Use the tags table to:

- Sort tag keys by the **Count column** (count of unique tag values).
- Search through the paginated table of tags for a particular tag key.
- Export the tags table as a downloadable CSV.
- Toggle between tags you've configured on your metric vs the metric's originally submitted tags

For any particular tag key, you can:

- Inspect all tag values of that tag key.
- Use a specific tag `key:value` to further filter the list of metrics displayed on the Metrics Summary page.
- Open a graph of this metric filtered by your tag `key:value` pair in the Metrics Explorer.
- Copy any tag `key:value` for filtering across the application.

## Metrics without Limits™
Metrics without Limits™ provides you control over the size of your custom metrics without requiring any agent or code-level changes. 

**Note:** Metrics without Limits™ is only available for custom metrics.

You can configure tags using the bulk metric tag configuration button or the **Manage Tags** button in a metric's details side panel. 

{{< img src="metrics/distributions/managetags.png" alt="Configuring tags on a distribution" style="width:80%;">}}

1. Click on your custom distribution metric name in the **Metrics Summary** table to open the metrics details side panel.
2. Click the **Manage Tags** button to open the tag configuration modal.

3. Select **Include tags...** or **Exclude tags...** to customize the tags you do or don't want to query for. For more information on tag configuration, see the [Metrics without Limits][10] documentation.
4. Preview the effects of your proposed tag configuration with the cardinality estimator before selecting **Save**.

**Note**: The cardinality estimator requires the metric to be older than 48 hours.

### Queryable tags 

Once your metric has been configured with Metrics without Limits™, you can view which tags remain Queryable -- ultimately those that contribute to _Indexed Custom Metrics_ volume. And you can toggle back to all originally submitted and ingested tags that contribute to your _Ingested Custom Metrics_ volume. 

### Optimize your metric with aggregations in Advanced Mode

For custom metrics of the count, gauge, or rate metric type, you can further refine your metric's configurations by optionally including additional aggregations with the advanced mode of Metrics without Limits™. By default, Datadog stores the most frequently queried aggregation combination depending on the metric's type to preserve the mathematical accuracy of your configured metric's query as listed below: 

- Configured counts/rates are queryable with time/space aggregations of `SUM`
- Configured gauges are queryable in time/space aggregations of `AVG`

{{< img src="metrics/summary/customize_aggr_docs.jpg" alt="Refine aggregations on counts, rates, and gauges" style="width:80%;">}}

More aggregations are available should they be valuable to you. You can add or remove aggregations at any time with no required Agent or code-level changes.

**Note**: Configuring your count, rate, or gauge metric and removing an aggregation may impact existing dashboards and monitors.
