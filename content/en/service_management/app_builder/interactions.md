Use JavaScript (JS) expressions to create interactions between components in your app. You can use a JS expression enclosed in `${}` anywhere in App Builder, including next to component properties where the code editor symbol **</>** is shown. Clicking the symbol opens a code editor.

<div class="alert alert-info">Some fields in App Builder, like <a href="/service_management/app_builder/build/#post-query-transformation">post-query transformations</a> display a code editor by default, usually pre-populated with some JS comments. In these situations, use regular JS script instead of `${}` expressions.</div>

- Using **App State**: Click anywhere on the canvas to open the app properties panel and scroll down to **App State**.
- Using **Inspect Data**: Select a query
- Using the **Admin Console**: Click **Settings**, **Admin Console**, and select the **Data** tab.
