## Overview

The CI Results Explorer gives you visibility into your CI jobs executing Synthetic tests. It allows you to:

* Drill down into each CI job execution to identify and troubleshoot failing test results
* Compare test results executed against various devices and browsers to pinpoint cross browser and device issues
* Keep track of the progress of your tests in CI pipelines
* Identify flaky tests that might need to be fixed

## Exploring batches

The CI Results Explorer displays all batches of tests executed via the [Synthetic CI/CD testing integration][TO DO]. Each batch corresponds to a call to the Datadog API (via the NPM package or directly via the API endpoint) to trigger one or several test executions . 

When clicking on a batch, a side panel with data about the CI metadata as well as test results shows up.
