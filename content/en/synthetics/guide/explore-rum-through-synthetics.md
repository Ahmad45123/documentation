## Overview

<div class="alert alert-info">If you don’t have Real User Monitoring, you can access a preview of RUM, Session Replay, Error Tracking, and additional performance data from your Synthetic browser test runs.</div>

In your browser test recording, click **Collect Real User Monitoring Data on** above the **Start Recording** button and select an application to collect data on. After saving your recording and test configuration, RUM gathers test data and generates session recordings from your browser test runs.

## Synthetics to RUM Explorer

Navigate to your [list of browser tests][1] and click on a sample test run. 

The step details side panel appears with `This Synthetic test generated data in Real User Monitoring` and includes the session ID and the **Go to the View in RUM** button. 

To see this test step's errors, resources, and performance data in the [RUM Explorer][2], click **Go to the View in RUM**. Alternatively, click the **Replay Session** button or **View all sessions in RUM** to explore available session replays captured in your browser test.

## RUM Explorer to Synthetics

The session panel appears with `This event was generated by a Synthetic test run` and includes the test ID and the **View Synthetic Test Result** button.

To navigate back to Synthetics and your test’s results, click **View Synthetic Test Result**.
