## Overview

<div class="alert alert-info">If you don’t have Real User Monitoring, you can access a preview of RUM, Session Replay, Error Tracking, and additional performance data from your Synthetic browser test runs.</div>

In your browser test recording, click **Collect RUM Data on** above the **Start Recording** button and select an application to collect data on. After saving your recording and test configuration, RUM gathers test data and generates session recordings from your browser test runs. 

You have access to:

- **Session Replay** for all tests. This provides additional context beyond the screenshots available for each step and includes Dev Tools.
- The session in the Real User Monitoring Explorer.
- Aggregated errors across your different steps, tests, and test runs with **Error Tracking**. This allows you to scope the error impact and prioritize fixing the most severe issues. 
- Extra resources and timing information from RUM including additional search and monitor capabilities.


## Synthetics to RUM Explorer

Navigate to your [list of browser tests][1] and click on a sample test run.
