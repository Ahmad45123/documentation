## How does Dynamic Instrumentation work?

Dynamic instrumentation allows users to add probes to their production systems at anypoint in their code (and even 3rd party libraries). Dynamic Instrumentation has low overhead and is guaranteed to have no side effects on your system.

## What data does a Dynamic Instrumentation Snapshot probe capture

Dynamic instrumentation captures the current context of a method or line:
* Method Arguments, Local Variables and fields. 
* * Captures 3 levels deep of class objects
* * Limit to the first 100 items inside collections
* * Limit string values to 255 characters
* * Limit to 20 collected fields in an object
* Call Stack
* Caught & uncaught exceptions 

## What probe types does Dynamic Instrumentation support?

* *Snapshot probe* - captures the context of a method/line (rate limited for 1 snapshot per sec)
* * Method arguments, Local Variables and fields, all captured at 3 levels deep.
* * Stack trace
* * Exceptions
* *Metric probes* - generate a dynamic metric 
* * Support: Count, Gauge and Histogram metrics
* * Use any argument, local variables or field as a metric value
