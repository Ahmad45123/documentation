The pie chart widget allows you to display proportions of one or datasets. This widget can display a single dataset with corresponding proportions, or multiple datasets with nested proportions.

In the example below, unique page views stemming from the RUM dataset are shown at both the country and browser level. The innermost ring shows the userâ€™s country, and the outermost ring is segmented proportionally to show the share of browsers used in each country.
