The **Log Explorer** is your home base for log troubleshooting and exploration. Whether you start from scratch, from a [Saved View][1], or land here from any other context like monitor notifications or dashboard widgets, the Log Explorer is designed to iteratively:

1. [**Filter**][2] logs; to narrow down, broaden, or shift your focus on the subset of logs of current interest.
2. [**Group**][3] queried logs into higher-level entities in order to derive or consolidate information.
3. [**Visualize**][4] the outcome of filters and aggregations to put your logs into the right perspective and bubble up decisive information.

At any moment, [**Export**][5] your Log Explorer view to reuse it later or in different contexts.
