## Overview

The Datadog Security Platform unifies developer, operation, and security teams through one platform. Use a single dashboard to display DevOps content, business metrics, and security content. Detect threats, like a targeted attack, an IP communicating with your systems which matches a threat intel list, or an insecure configuration, to your application and infrastructure in real time, and notify your team of security issues by email, slack, Jira, PagerDuty, or a webhook.
