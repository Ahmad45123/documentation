**Should we include a screenshot or video here? The only caveat is that I've had challenges with getting the Resource Catalog to work consistently (I often have to refresh the page to get it to display correctly).**

## Overview

Datadog Resource Catalog is a centralized place to access important information about all host and cloud infrastructure in your organization. See what team is responsible for each resource, and what security findings have been found. Access dashboards and Datadog views that receive and monitor telemetry and security data for each resource.

Compared to the Infrastructure List, the Resource Catalog includes cloud resources crawled from cloud provider APIs, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP.

**Note**: In order for cloud resources to appear in the Resource Catalog, you must first enable Cloud Security Posture Management for each cloud provider.

The Resource Catalog is useful for:

- Training new site reliability and security engineers by providing a clear view of all resources, their relationships, and their security findings, along with information about teams responsible for them and services running on them.
- Speeding incident recovery by increasing confidence and simplifying locating owners of upstream and downstream resources.
- Detecting which resources aren't reporting security findings so that you can rectify the oversight.
- Facilitating the practice of good tagging to optimize cross-telemetry insights.
- Providing engineering leadership with a high-level view of security practices across teams and services.

## Browse the Resource Catalog

On the [Resource Catalog page][1], see the cloud resources in your Datadog organization which are either detected from an Agent on a host, or from configuring a cloud integration on the resource. Information about the resources in your organization is organized into two views: List and Map.

### List view

The Resource Catalog list is sortable by cloud platform, resource type, and many of the other columns. You can find resources with active issues by sorting by the **Threats** column. Or you can sort by **Findings** to see the resources with the most security rules assigned to them.

To find a particular resource, search by its name. To filter the list, select one or more facets. You may find it helpful to filter by your team name or scope the findings displayed to particular environments and clusters in order to see only matching resources in the list.

### Map view

The Resource Catalog map provides a visualization of the resources in your organization. Each color corresponds to the highest severity rule assigned to a resource. To find a particular resource, search by its name. You may find it helpful to group resources by region any apply filters such as cloud provider and resource type to see only matching resources in the map.

## Investigate a resource

Clicking on a resource opens a side panel with details including:

- **Resource information** such as the resource type, name, account, and tags associated with the resource.
- **Security findings** including the security rules and latest status.
- **Real-time threat signals** generated by the asset and detected by Cloud Workload Security.
- **Resource definition** in JSON showing the full configuration of the asset retrieved from the Cloud Provider API.
- An interactive resource map displaying the assets connected to the resource.

Click the **Share** button and select **Share Findings** to share a link to the current resource with your teammates through email, Slack, and more. See all of the [Datadog notification integrations][2] available for this feature.
