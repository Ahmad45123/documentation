## Overview

Datadog Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) makes it easier to assess and visualize the current and historic security posture of your cloud environment, automate audit evidence collection, and catch misconfigurations that leave your organization vulnerable to attacks.

Assess the configuration of your cloud resources, such as security groups, storage buckets, load balancers, and databases against CSPM controls. Use the Datadog Agent to review local configuration information from servers, containers, and Kubernetes clusters against security best practices.

View your cloud security posture at a higher level level with the CSPM Home page, and drill into the details of findings and analyze historical configurations with the Findings Explorer.
