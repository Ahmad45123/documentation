Datadog provides out-of-the-box (OOTB) rules to flag attacker techniques and potential misconfigurations so that you can immediately take steps to remediate. Datadog continuously develops new default rules, which are automatically imported into your account.

- **Log Detection** to see OOTB [Cloud SIEM][1] rules.

- **Cloud Configuration** or **Infrastructure Configuration** to see the [Cloud Security Posture Management][3] rules.
