Set up your application to [detect threats][1] targeting your production systems, using the Datadog library for your application language. 

In general, setting up Application Security monitoring involves:

1. Installing the Datadog Library (the most recent APM tracing library) and enabling it within your services.
2. Enabling the Agent to collect the application security data from the services and send it to Datadog.

Select your application language for details on how to do these steps for your language and infrastructure types.
