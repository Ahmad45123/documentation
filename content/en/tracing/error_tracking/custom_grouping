## Overview

Error Tracking intelligently groups similar errors into issues with a default strategy. However, it's also possible to
customize the grouping behavior and gain full control over the grouping decision for your error spans.

This is achieved by providing the material Error Tracking will use to create issues in an
`error.fingerprint` span tag. The content of the `error.fingerprint` needs to be a string but doesn't have any other
particular format or requirement.

If `error.fingerprint` is provided, the grouping behavior follows these rules:

* Custom grouping takes precedence over the default strategy.
* Custom grouping can be applied only to a subset of your error spans and can coexist with the default strategy.
* The content of `error.fingerprint` is used as-is without any modification.
* Spans with the same `error.fingerprint` attribute are grouped into the same Error Tracking issue.
* Spans with different `service` attributes are grouped into different Error Tracking issues.

## Setup

Custom grouping only needs an error span and an `error.fingerprint` string span tag.

If you arenâ€™t already collecting APM traces with Datadog, see the [APM documentation][1] to set up APM.

### Example

If you're already sending APM spans, just add a new `error.fingerprint` tag to your error span.

Here's an example in Python:

```python
with tracer.trace("throws.an.error") as span:
  span.set_tag('error.fingerprint', 'my-custom-grouping-material')
  raise Exception("Something went wrong")
```

Exception information is captured and attached to a span if there is one active when the exception is raised.
In this case, `my-custom-grouping-material` is used to group these error spans into a single
issue in Error Tracking.
