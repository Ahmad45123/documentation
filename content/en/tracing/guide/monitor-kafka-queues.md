## Monitor Kafka queues

In event-driven pipelines, queuing and streaming technologies such as Kafka are essential to the successful operation of your systems. However, ensuring that messages are being reliably and quickly conveyed between services is difficult due to the many technologies and teams involved in any such environment. Datadog's Kafka integration and its APM suite enables your team to monitor your infrastructure and pipelines health and efficiency.

### Integration

Easily visualize the performance of your cluster in real time and correlate the performance of Kafka with the rest of your applications by using [Datadog's Kafka integration][1]. Datadog also provide a [MSK integration][2] if need be.

### Data Stream Monitoring

[Datadog Data Streams Monitoring][3] provides a standardized method for your teams to measure pipeline health and end-to-end latencies for events traversing across your system. The deep visibility offered by Data Streams Monitoring enables you to pinpoint faulty producers, consumers, or queues driving delays and lag in the pipeline; discover hard-to-debug pipeline issues such as blocked messages, hot partitions, or offline consumers; and collaborate seamlessly across relevant infrastructure or app teams.

### Collect distributed traces

Datadog APM and distributed tracing gives you expanded visibility into the performance of your services by measuring request volume and latency. You create graphs and alerts to monitor your APM data, and you can visualize the activity of a single request in a flame graph like the one shown below to better understand the sources of latency and errors.

<br>
Datadog APM can automatically trace requests to and from Kafka clients. This means you can collect traces without modifying your source code. Note that we inject headers in the kafka messages to be able to propagate the context of the trace from the producer to the consumer.

#### Setup

To trace kafka applications, we actually trace the producing and consuming calls within the Kafka SDK. So to monitor Kafka, you just have to setup APM on your services. See [the documentation][4] for guidance on getting started with APM and distributed tracing.

#### Monitor in the APM UI

A classic Kafka setup will show a trace with a producer span, and as a child, a consumer span. Any work that would generate a trace in the consumption side will be represented by child spans of the consumer span.
Each spans contain a set of tags with the `messaging` prefix. Below, the tags you can find on Kafka spans.

#### Special use cases

{{< tabs >}}

{{% tab "Java" %}}

Datadogâ€™s Kafka integration works with Kafka version 0.11+, which supports the Header API. This API is used to inject and extract trace context. If you are running a mixed version environment, the Kafka broker can incorrectly report the newer version of Kafka. This causes an issue when the tracer tries to inject headers that are not supported by the local producer. Additionally, older consumers are unable to consume the message because of the presence of headers. To prevent these issues, if you are running a mixed version Kafka environment with versions older than 0.11, disable context propagation with the environment variable: `DD_KAFKA_CLIENT_PROPAGATION_ENABLED=false`.

{{% tab ".NET" %}}

The [Kafka.NET Client documentation][1] states that a typical Kafka consumer application is centered around a consume loop, which repeatedly calls the Consume method to retrieve records one-by-one. The `Consume` method polls the system for messages. Thus, by default, the consumer span is created when a message is returned and closed before consuming the next message. The span duration is then representative of the computation between one message consumption and the next.

When a message is not processed completely before consuming the next one, or when multiple messages are consumed at once, you can set `DD_TRACE_KAFKA_CREATE_CONSUMER_SCOPE_ENABLED` to false in your consuming application. When set to false, the consumer span is created and immediately closed. If you have child spans to trace, follow [this documentation][2] to extract the trace context.

#### Disable tracing for Kafka

If you want to disable tracing for Kafka, you can set `DD_TRACE_KAFKA_ENABLED` to false on the given applications.
