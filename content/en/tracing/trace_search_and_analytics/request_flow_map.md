## Overview

Request Flow Maps combine two important features of Datadog APM: the [service map][1] and [live search and analytics][2] to help you understand and track request paths through your stack.  Quickly identify noisy services and chokepoints, or how many database calls are generated by a request to a specific endpoint.

No additional configuration is required to use these flow maps, and they are powered by your [ingested spans][3].  Scope your LIVE (last 15 minutes) traces to any combination of tags and generate a dynamic map representing the flow of requests between every service.  The map is automatically generated based on your search criteria, and will regenerate live after any changes.

## Using the Request Flow Map:

- Hover an edge connecting two services to see metrics for requests, errors, and latency for requests between those two services matching the query parameters.
- The highest throughput connections are highlighted on the map by default to show the most common path.
- Use the 'Export' button to save a .png image of the current request flow map. This is a great way to generate a live architecture diagram, or one scoped to a specific user flow.

- Click any service on the map to view the overall health and performance information for that service for easy comparison (throughput, latency, error rates, monitor status) along with infrastructure and runtime metrics.
- There are two layouts for Request Flow Maps, 'Cluster' and 'Flow'. By default, the map will automatically select an appropriate layout based on the number of services present.

- RUM Applications are represented on the Request Flow Map if you have [connected RUM and Traces][4].

Try the [request flow map][5] today!  If the map takes awhile to render, start your investigation by querying for your favorite service.

### Examples

There are many ways to use the request flow map to investigate your application's behavior.  Two examples

- Search for a [resource][6] that corresponds to a particular HTTP request.
- If you are using [shadow deployments][7] or feature flags set as [custom span tags][8], use the request flow map to compare request latency between requests.  This can be a great pre-production compliment to [deployment tracking][9] to observe how potential code changes will impact latency of deployed verisons.
