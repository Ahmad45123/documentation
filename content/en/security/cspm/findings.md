## Overview

The [Findings Explorer][1] allows you to:

- Review the detailed configuration of a resource
- Review the detection rules applied to your resources by CSPM
- Review tags for more context about who owns the resource and where it resides in your environment
- Read descriptions and guidelines based on industry resources for remediating a misconfigured resource
- Use the “time selector” to explore your security configuration posture at any point in the past.

In addition to reviewing and responding to findings, you can set notifications for failed findings, and configure signals to correlate and triage misconfigurations in the same view as real-time threats generated by [Cloud SIEM][2] and [Cloud Workload Security][3]. This allows users to accelerate investigations as the root-cause for many of today’s cloud breaches are misconfigured services that have been nefariously exploited.

## Findings

A finding is the primary primitive for a rule evaluation against a resource. Every time a resource is evaluated against a rule, a finding is generated with a **Pass** or **Fail** status. Resources are evaluated in increments between 15 minutes and four hours (depending on type). Datadog generates new findings as soon as a new scan is completed, and stores a complete history of all findings for the past 15 months so they are available in case of an investigation or audit.

## Explore your cloud misconfigurations with Findings

Clicking on an individual finding that has **failed** to see details about the misconfigured resource, the rule description, its framework or industry benchmark mapping, and suggested remediation steps.

{{< img src="security/cspm/findings/signal-overview.png" alt="Failed signals in the side panel" style="width:65%;">}}

Aggregate findings by rule using the query search bar. This view shows a checklist of all of the detection rules that Datadog scans. Filtering by `evaluation:fail` status narrows the list to all detection rules that have issues that need to be addressed. The side panel shows details of each resource that has been evaluated by the rule.

The side panel shows details of each resource that has been evaluated by the rule.

{{< img src="security/cspm/findings/no-security-group-ingress.png" alt="Ranked order resources in the side panel" style="width:65%;">}}

Findings can also be aggregated by resource to rank order resources that have failed the most rule evaluations so you can prioritize remediation.

The side panel lists detection rules that were evaluated against the resource, some of which you may choose to be addressed to improve your security configuration posture.

## Mute findings

<div class="alert alert-info">Muted findings is a beta feature. If you have any feedback or questions, contact <a href="/help">Datadog support</a>.</div>

There may be times where a finding does not match the use case for your business, or you accept it as a known risk. To ignore these types of findings, you can mute the finding for the impacted resource. This allows you to focus on high-severity and critical findings that require your attention.

For example, the ['Block Public Access' feature is enabled for S3 bucket][4] rule evaluates whether a S3 bucket is publicly accessible. If you have a S3 bucket with static assets that are meant to be publicly shared, you can mute the finding for the S3 bucket.

Muted findings do not appear in visualizations and do not impact your posture score. You can mute pass/fail findings at any time. CSPM also provides [several methods](#audit-your-muted-findings) for auditing your muted findings.

**placeholder for screenshot**

1. On the [finding side panel](#explore-your-cloud-misconfigurations-with-findings), select a resource.
2. Click **Mute**.
3. Select a reason for the mute:
    - Pending fix
    - False positive
    - Accepted risk
    - Other
4. Enter an optional **Description**.
5. Select the duration of the mute:
    - 2 weeks
    - 1 month
    - 3 months
    - Indefinite
    - Custom
6. Click **Mute**.

### Unmute a finding

Muted findings automatically unmute after the specified mute duration expires. If necessary, you can also manually unmute a finding.

1. On the [finding side panel](#explore-your-cloud-misconfigurations-with-findings), select the resource with the muted finding.
2. Click **Unmute**.
3. Select a reason for the unmute:
    - No Pending Fix
    - Human Error
    - No Longer Accepted Risk
    - Other
4. Enter an optional **Description**.
5. Click **Unmute**.

### Audit your muted findings

CSPM provides several options for viewing your muted findings. 

This allows you to audit your findings, as well as review whether a muted finding is currently in a pass or fail state for a given resource.

- Sort by the **Muted** column on the Security Findings Explorer.
- Filter the Security Findings Explorer using the **Muted** facet.
- View finding > Timeline

Determine who (un)muted findings for accountability purposes

“Muted” status changes are documented in a finding’s Timeline (i.e. it will not be retroactive - the suppression applies starting upon change) and will show:

Editor details
When the change was made
Reason for the status change
Duration until mute resets to pass/fail (if applicable)
Any time the status of a finding is changed, an Audit Log must be generated and include:
Editor details
When the change was made
Reason for the status change
Duration until mute resets to pass/fail (if applicable)
