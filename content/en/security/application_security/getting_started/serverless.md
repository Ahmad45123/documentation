{{< callout url="#" header="ASM support for AWS Lambda is in beta" btn_hidden="true" >}}
  Threat detection is done by using the Lambda extension.
{{< /callout >}}

You can monitor your functions running in AWS Lambda with Datadog Application Security Management (ASM). 

In general, setting up ASM for AWS Lambda involves:

1. Identifying functions that are vulnerable or are under attack, which would most benefit from ASM. Find them on [the Security tab of your Service Catalog][1].
2. Set up ASM instrumentation via the serverless plugin or manually setting the ARN.
3. Enabling the library to collect the application security data from the functions and send it to Datadog.
4. Triggering security signals in your application and seeing how Datadog displays the resulting information.

## Prerequisites

- [Serverless APM][2] is configured to send traces directly to Datadog (canâ€™t use X-Ray integration) 

## Get started

{{% tab "Serverless Framework" %}}

The [Datadog Serverless plugin][1] automatically configures your functions to send metrics, traces, and logs to Datadog through the [Datadog Lambda Extension][2].

To install and configure the Datadog Serverless plugin:

1. Install the Datadog Serverless plugin:
   ```sh
   serverless plugin install --name serverless-plugin-datadog
   ```
2. Enable ASM by updating your `serverless.yml` (or whichever way you set environment variables for your function):
   ```yaml
   environment:
     DD_SERVERLESS_APPSEC_ENABLED: true
   ```
   For **Go functions only** also add:
   ```yaml
   DD_UNIVERSAL_INSTRUMENTATION:
     environment:
       DD_UNIVERSAL_INSTRUMENATION: true
   ```
3. Redeploy the function.

4. To see Application Security Management threat detection in action, send known attack patterns to your application. For example, with an HTTP header with value `acunetix-product` to trigger a [security scanner attack][4] attempt:
   ```sh
   curl -H 'My-ASM-Test-Header: acunetix-product' https://your-application-url/existing-route
   ```

1. Install the Datadog tracer:
   - **Java**: [Configure the layers][1] for your Lambda function using the ARN in one of the following format, depending on where your Lambda is deployed:
     ```
     # In AWS commercial regions
     arn:aws:lambda:<AWS_REGION>:464622532012:layer:dd-trace-java:8
     # In AWS GovCloud regions
     arn:aws-us-gov:lambda:<AWS_REGION>:002406178527:layer:dd-trace-java:8
     ```
   - **Go**: The Go tracer doesn't rely on a layer and is a regular Go module. You you can upgrade to its latest version with:
     ```sh
     go get -u github.com/DataDog/datadog-lambda-go
     ```
   - **.NET**: [Configure the layers][1] for your Lambda function using the ARN in one of the following format, depending on where your Lambda is deployed:

A few minutes after you enable your application and exercise it, **threat information appears in the [Application Signals Explorer][3]** and **vulnerability information appears in the [Vulnerability Explorer][4]**.
