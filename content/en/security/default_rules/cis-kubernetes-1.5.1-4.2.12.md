## Description

Enable kubelet server certificate rotation.

## Rationale

`RotateKubeletServerCertificate` causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there are no downtimes due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad.

*Note*: This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself.

## Audit

Run the following command on each node: `ps -ef | grep kubelet`. Verify that `RotateKubeletServerCertificate` argument exists and is set to `true`.

## Remediation

On the master edit `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` and set the parameter `KUBELET_CERTIFICATE_ARGS --feature-gates=RotateKubeletServerCertificate=true` or as an alternative, and suggested as a last resort, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_CERTIFICATE_ARGS` variable:

```
--feature-gates=RotateKubeletServerCertificate=true
```

Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example: `systemctl daemon-reload systemctl restart kubelet.service`

## Impact

None

## Default value

By default, kubelet server certificate rotation is disabled.
