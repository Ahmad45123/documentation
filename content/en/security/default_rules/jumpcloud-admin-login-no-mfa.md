## Goal
Detect when a JumpCloud administrator authenticates without multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled. This is not indicative of malicious activity, however as a best practice, administrator accounts should have MFA enabled.

## Strategy
This rule monitors JumpCloud audit logs to detect when an admin user successfully authenticates to JumpCloud and the log indicates that `@mfa` is `false`.

## Triage and response
1. Reach out to the {{@usr.name}} to determine if the login was legitimate.
2. If the login was legitimate, request that the user enables MFA.
3. If the login wasnâ€™t legitimate, rotate the credentials, enable MFA and triage an actions uncovered from step 1.
4. Review all user accounts to ensure MFA is enabled.
