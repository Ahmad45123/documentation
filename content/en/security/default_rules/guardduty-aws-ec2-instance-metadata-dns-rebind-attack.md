title: AWS EC2 Instance Victim to Metadata DNS Rebind Attack
type: security_rules
---

## Goal
Detect when an EC2 instance makes a DNS request and resolves to the AWS metadata IP address (169.254.169.254).

## Strategy
This rule lets you monitor this [GuardDuty integration][1] finding:

* [UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/MetadataDNSRebind][2]


## Triage and response
1. Determine which process made the DNS request. The DNS request can be found in the samples.
2. Ensure the process is not a victim of an SSRF attack to steal the AWS EC2 Instance profile's STS credentials.  
2. If the STS credentials are compromised:
   * Review the AWS [documentation][3] on revoking the session.
