title: AWS IAM user changing sensitive configurations
type: security_rules

## Goal
Detect when an AWS IAM user is changing sensitive configurations and has no prior history of invoking these APIs.

## Strategy
This rule lets you monitor these [GuardDuty integration][1] findings:

* [Stealth:IAMUser/S3ServerAccessLoggingDisabled][2]
* [Stealth:IAMUser/PasswordPolicyChange][3]
* [Stealth:IAMUser/CloudTrailLoggingDisabled][4]
* [Stealth:IAMUser/LoggingConfigurationModified][5]

## Triage and response
1. Determine which user triggered the signal. This can be found in the signal.
2. Determine if the user's credentials are compromised.  
3. If the user's credentials are compromised:
  * Review the AWS [documentation][6] on remediating compromised AWS credentials.
