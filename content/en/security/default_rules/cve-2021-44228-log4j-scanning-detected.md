title: Log4j Scanner detected in user agent or referrer
type: security_rules

## Goal
This rule detects if your Apache or NGINX web servers are being scanned for the log4j vulnerability. The initial vulnerability was identified as [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228).

## Strategy
This signal evaluated that `jndi:(ldap OR rmi OR dns)` has been detected in the HTTP header fields `user agent` and `referrer` or `referer`.

## Triage and response
1. Ensure you servers have the most recent version of log4j installed. 
2. Check if the `Base64 was detected in an http.user_agent or http.referrer` rule was also triggered and follow the `Triage and response` steps in that rule.
