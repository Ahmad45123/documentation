title: IP forwarding is not enabled on instances
type: security_rules
---

## Description
Compute Engine instance cannot forward a packet unless the source IP address of the
packet matches the IP address of the instance. Similarly, GCP won't deliver a packet whose
destination IP address is different than the IP address of the instance receiving the packet.
However, both capabilities are required if you want to use instances to help route packets.

Disable the forwarding of data packets to prevent data loss or information
disclosure.

## Rationale
To enable source and destination IP check, disable the `canIpForward` option, which
allows an instance to send and receive packets with non-matching destination or source
IPs.

## Impact
Deleting instances that act as routers or packet forwarders may break network
connectivity.

## Exception
Instances created by GKE should be excluded because they need to have IP forwarding
enabled and cannot be changed. Instances created by GKE have names that start with `gke-`.

## Remediation
You can only edit the `canIpForward` setting at instance creation time. Therefore, if `canIpForward` is set to false for an instance, you must delete the instance and create a new one.

### From the console
1. Go to the `VM Instances` page: 
[https://pantheon.corp.google.com/compute/instances][1].
2. Select the `VM Instance` you want to remediate.
3. Click the `Delete` button.
4. On the `VM Instances` page, click `CREATE INSTANCE`.
5. Create a new instance with the desired configuration. By default, the instance is
configured to not allow IP forwarding.

### From the command line
1. Delete the instance:
   ```
   gcloud compute instances delete INSTANCE_NAME
   ```
2. Create a new instance to replace it, with IP forwarding set to Off
   ```
   gcloud compute instances create
   ```

## Default Value:
By default, instances are not configured to allow IP forwarding.

## Additional Information:

You can only set the `canIpForward` field at instance creation time. After an instance is
created, the field becomes read-only.

## CIS Controls

Version 8 - 4.4: Implement and Manage a Firewall on Servers
- Implement and manage a firewall on servers, where supported. Example
implementations include a virtual firewall, operating system firewall, or a third-party
firewall agent.

Version 8 - 4.5: Implement and Manage a Firewall on End-User Devices
- Implement and manage a host-based firewall or port-filtering tool on end-user
devices, with a default-deny rule that drops all traffic except those services and ports
that are explicitly allowed.

Version 7 - 11.1 Maintain Standard Security Configurations for Network
Devices
- Maintain standard, documented security configuration standards for all authorized
network devices.

Version 7 - 11.2 Document Traffic Configuration Rules
- All configuration rules that allow traffic to flow through network devices should be
documented in a configuration management system with a specific business reason for
each rule, a specific individualâ€™s name responsible for that business need, and an
expected duration of the need.
