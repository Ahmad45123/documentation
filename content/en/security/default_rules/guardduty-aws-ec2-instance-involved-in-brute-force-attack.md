## Goal
Detect Brute Force Attacks

## Strategy
Leverage GuardDuty and detect when an attacker is performing a brute force attack. The following are GuardDuty findings trigger this signal:

* [UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce][1]
* [UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/RDPBruteForce][2]


## Triage and response
1. Inspect the role of the EC2 instance in the attack. Find the role in the signal name - either `ACTOR` or `TARGET`.
   * If you are the `TARGET` and the instance is available on the internet, expect to see IPs scanning your systems.
   * If you are the `TARGET` and the instance is **not** available on the internet, this means a host on your internal network is scanning your EC2 instance. Open an investigation.
   * If you are the `ACTOR`, this means that your instance is performing brute force attacks on other systems. Open an investigation.
