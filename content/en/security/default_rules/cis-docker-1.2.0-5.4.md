## Description

Using the `--privileged` flag provides all Linux kernel capabilities to the container to which it is applied and therefore overwrites the `--cap-add` and `--cap-drop` flags. For this reason, ensure that it is not used.

## Rationale

The `--privileged` flag provides all capabilities to the container to which it is applied, and also lifts all the limitations enforced by the device cgroup controller. As a consequence this the container has most of the rights of the underlying host. This flag only exists to allow for specific use cases (for example running Docker within Docker) and should not generally be used.

## Audit

Run this command: `docker ps --quiet --all | xargs docker inspect --format '{{ .Id }}: Privileged={{ .HostConfig.Privileged }}'` This command returns `Privileged=false` for each container instance.

## Remediation

Do not run containers with the `--privileged` flag. For example, do not start a container using the command `docker run --interactive --tty --privileged centos /bin/bash`

## Impact

If you start a container without the `--privileged` flag, it will not have excessive default capabilities.

## Default value

False
