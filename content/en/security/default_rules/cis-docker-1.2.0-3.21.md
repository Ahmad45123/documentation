## Description

You should verify that the `/etc/sysconfig/docker` file permissions are correctly set to 644 or more restrictively.

## Rationale

The `/etc/sysconfig/docker` file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior of the Docker daemon. It should therefore be writeable only by root in order to ensure that it is not modified by less privileged users.

## Audit

Verify that the `/etc/sysconfig/docker` file permissions are set to `644` or more restrictive, by running: 
```
stat -c %a /etc/sysconfig/docker
```

## Remediation

Run the following command: `chmod 644 /etc/sysconfig/docker`

This sets the file permissions for this file to 644.

## Impact

None

## Default value

This file may not be present on the system and in this case, this recommendation is not applicable.
