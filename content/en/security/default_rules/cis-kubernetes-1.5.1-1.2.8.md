title: Kubelet nodes are only authorized to read objects they are associated with
type: security_rules
---

## Description

Restrict kubelet nodes to reading only objects associated with them.

## Rationale

The Node authorization mode only allows kubelets to read Secret, ConfigMap, PersistentVolume, and PersistentVolumeClaim objects associated with their nodes.

## Audit

Run the following command on the master node:
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```
Verify that the `--authorization-mode` argument exists and is set to a value to include Node.

## Remediation

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to a value that includes Node. `--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC`

## Impact

None

## Default value

By default, Node authorization is not enabled.
