title: Docker daemon logging level is set to 'info'
type: security_rules
---

## Description

Set Docker daemon log level to `info`.

## Rationale

Setting up an appropriate log level configures the Docker daemon to log events that you would want to review later. A base log level of `info` and above captures all logs except `debug` logs. Unless required, you should not run Docker daemon at `debug` log level.

## Audit

To confirm that the log level setting is `info`, review both the `dockerd` startup options, and also the log level settings in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. To review the `dockerd` startup options, run: 
```
ps -ef | grep dockerd 
```
Ensure that either the `--log-level` parameter is not present or if present, that it is set to `info`. 

Similarly, review the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` for the `log-level` setting.

## Remediation

Ensure that the Docker daemon configuration file has the following configuration included:

```
"log-level": "info" 
```

Alternatively, run the Docker daemon with the `log-level` specified:

```
dockerd --log-level="info"
```

## Impact

None.

## Default value

By default, Docker daemon is set to log level of `info`.

Version 6.6.2 Ensure Audit Log Settings Support Appropriate Log Entry Formatting - Validate audit log settings for each hardware device and the software installed on it, ensuring that logs include a date, timestamp, source addresses, destination addresses, and various other useful elements of each packet and/or transaction. Systems should record logs in a standardized format such as syslog entries or those outlined by the Common Event Expression initiative. If systems cannot generate logs in a standardized format, log normalization tools can be deployed to convert logs into such a format. 

Version 7.6.2 Activate audit logging - Ensure that local logging has been enabled on all systems and networking devices. 

Version 6.3 Enable Detailed Logging - Enable system logging to include detailed information such as an event source, date, user, timestamp, source addresses, destination addresses, and other useful elements.
