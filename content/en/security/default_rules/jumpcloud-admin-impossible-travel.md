## Goal
Detect an Impossible Travel event with a JumpCloud administrator.

## Strategy
The Impossible Travel detection typeâ€™s algorithm compares the GeoIP data of the last log and the current log to determine if the user (`@usr.name`) traveled more than 500km at over 1,000km/h.

## Triage and response
1. Determine if {@usr.name}} should be connecting from {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.first_location.city}}, {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.first_location.country}} and {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.second_location.city}}, {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.second_location.country}} in a short period of time.
2. If the user should not be connecting from {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.first_location.city}}, {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.first_location.country}} or {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.second_location.city}}, {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.second_location.country}}, then consider isolating the account and reset credentials.
3. Use the Cloud SIEM - User Investigation dashboard to audit any user actions that may have occurred after the illegitimate login.
