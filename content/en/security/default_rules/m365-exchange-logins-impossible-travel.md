## Goal
Detect an Impossible Travel event by a user logging in to Microsoft Exchange.

## Strategy
The Impossible Travel detection typeâ€™s algorithm compares the GeoIP data of the last and the current Microsoft-365 mailbox login event (`@evt.name:MailboxLogin`) to determine if the user `{{@usr.name}}` traveled more than 500km at over 1,000km/hr.

## Triage and response
1. Determine if `{{@usr.name}}` should be connecting from `{{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.first_location.city}}, {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.first_location.country}}` and `{{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.second_location.city}}, {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.second_location.country}}` in a short period of time.
2. If the user should not be connecting from `{{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.first_location.city}}, {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.first_location.country}}` and `{{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.second_location.city}}, {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.second_location.country}}`, then consider isolating the account and reset credentials.
3. Use the Cloud SIEM - User Investigation dashboard to audit any user actions that may have occurred after the illegitimate login.
