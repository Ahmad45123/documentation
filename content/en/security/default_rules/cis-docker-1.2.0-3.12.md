title: Docker server certificate file permissions are set to read-only or more restrictive
type: security_rules
---

## Description

You should verify that the Docker server certificate file, the file that is passed along with the `--tlscert` parameter, has permissions of 444 or more restrictive permissions.

## Rationale

The Docker server certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to authenticate the Docker server based on the given server certificate. It should therefore have permissions of 444 to prevent its modification.

## Audit

Verify that the Docker server certificate file has permissions of `444` or more restrictive, by running: 
```
stat -c %a <path to Docker server certificate file>
```

## Remediation

Run the command below: `chmod 444 <path to Docker server certificate file>`

This sets the file permissions of the Docker server certificate file to 444.

## Impact

None

## Default value

By default, the permissions for the Docker server certificate file might not be 444. The default file permissions are governed by the operating system or user specific umask values.
