title: AWS EC2 instance outbound connections to TOR
type: security_rules
---

## Goal
Detect when an EC2 instance makes an outbound network connection from TOR.

## Strategy
This rule lets you monitor this [GuardDuty integration][1] finding:

* [UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/TorClient][2]


## Triage and response
1. Determine if the EC2 instance should be making requests to TOR. 
2. If the instance is compromised:
   * Review the AWS [documentation][3] on remediating a compromised EC2 instance.
