title: AWS EBS Snapshot possible exfiltration
type: security_rules
---

## Goal
Detect the possible exfiltration of an EBS snapshot.

## Strategy
This rule allows you to monitor CloudTrail and detect the following API calls within a 15 minute time window:

* [`CreateSnapshot`][1]
* [`ModifySnapshotAttribute`][2]

An attacker can create a EBS snapshot from the EBS volume and modify the permissions of the snapshot to allow it to be shared [publicly][3] or with another AWS account. Using an attacker-controlled account, a new EBS volume can be created from the snapshot and attached to an EC2 instance for analysis.

## Triage and response
1. Determine if `{{@userIdentity.arn}}` should have made the API calls.
2. If the API call was not made by the user:
  * Rotate user credentials.
  * Determine what other API calls were made by the user.
  * Remove any snapshot attributes generated by the user with the `aws-cli` command [`modify-snapshot-attribute`][4].
  * Begin your organization's incident response process and investigate.
3. If the API calls were made by the user:
  * Determine if the user should be performing these API calls.
  * If **No**, see if other API calls were made by the user and determine if they warrant further investigation.

## Changelog
* 10 October 2022 - Updated query and severity.
