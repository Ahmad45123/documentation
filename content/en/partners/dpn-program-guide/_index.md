## About DPN

Thank you for your interest in the Datadog Partner Network (DPN). The DPN is designed to help partners enrich their product offerings and grow their businesses through stronger engagement with Datadog. This guide describes the DPN, including how to get involved, the rules and expectations governing participation, and an introduction of the materials available to Datadog partners.

DPN encompasses two types of partners: Sales and Services Partners and Technology Partners.

Within Sales and Services Partners there are three tracks designed for Managed Service Providers (MSPs), Consultants & Systems Integrators (SIs), and Resellers. These businesses directly manage end-customer environments while incorporating Datadog into their service offering, leverage expertise on Datadog by providing short- term consulting services, or resell Datadog’s services to customers.

Technology Partners are businesses offering integrations and complementary technologies or services to help customers achieve immediate time to value. Technology Partners can choose to list their offerings on Datadog’s community Integrations page and commercial Marketplace.

All Sales and Services Partners have access to the benefits of the Registered tier, while those who show greater commitment can earn more benefits through the Basic and Gold tiers. Major benefits include deal registration, access to Datadog training, marketing support and funds, and discounts on Datadog services. All Technology Partners are Registered tier Partners and enjoy benefits including sandbox accounts, access to Datadog training, and marketing support.

This guide is current as of March 2023. This guide is a part of the Datadog Partner Program Agreement (DPPA) and subject to its terms.

## Applying to the DPN Program

The first step to becoming a partner is submission of an online application through the partner portal at partners.datadoghq.com. This application will be reviewed by Datadog and eligible applicants will be contacted via email with temporary credentials to the portal. Eligible applicants must agree to the terms of the Datadog Partner Program Agreement (DPPA) when they log into the portal, after which they will be considered a Registered tier Partner. Registered Partners are encouraged to apply for one or more tracks, each of which is governed by the DPPA, a track-specific addendum to the DPPA, this guide, and any associated policies and documents. It is only after a Registered Partner is accepted into one or more tracks that a partner is able to unlock the full potential of the DPN.

## Partner Programs and Tiers

There are two partner programs: **Sales and Services** & **Technology**.

### Sales and Services Program

Within the Sales and Services program, there are three designated tracks: Managed Services Provider (MSPs), Reseller, and Consulting and SI Tracks. Please see below for how Datadog defines each track within the Sales and Services program. The Sales and Services program includes three tiers: Registered, Basic, and Gold. By showing commitment to one or more tracks through training, certification, and sales, partners can advance through tiers to earn additional benefits, such as more generous pricing incentives and funding from Datadog for marketing activities.

#### Managed Services Provider Track

The MSP Track is intended for businesses that primarily serve to directly manage end-customer environments. MSPs incorporate Datadog into their service offering. Unlike resellers, MSPs typically perform administrative functions in the platform on behalf of their customers, meaning the MSPs hold the subscription, must sign Datadog’s Master Service Agreement, close a set number of net new deals, and have active drawdowns. It includes two tiers: Basic and Gold.

#### Consultant & Systems Integrator (C&SI) Track

The C&SI Track is intended for businesses that primarily serve to provide project support for end customers but don’t have long-term obligations to directly manage the performance of client applications or infrastructure. They provide expert assessment, advisory, and hands-on expertise to end customers. Often they will have one or more professional services practice areas supporting Datadog and/or related technologies, platforms, and products (such as DevOps or Cloud Migration services). The track includes two tiers: Basic and Gold.

#### Reseller Track

The Reseller Track is intended for businesses that would like to resell Datadog’s services to end customers. Under this arrangement, the reseller’s end-customer signs Datadog’s Master Services Agreement (MSA) and uses the Datadog platform directly. It includes two tiers: Basic and Gold.

### Technology Program
The Technology Partners program is intended for businesses that offer a service or technology that is adjacent or complementary to Datadog’s product suite. All Technology Partners can request and gain access to a Datadog sandbox account for building and testing their offering. Partners can list their integration for free on the Datadog Integrations page, or commercially sell integrations, software licenses, or professional services directly to Datadog’s customers in the Marketplace.

## Get Started

## Program Benefits Definitions

### Sales and Technical Quick-Start Enablement

Datadog offers sales enablement for all partners. Registered tier, Basic tier, and Gold tier Partners have access to sales enablement materials and resources in the Asset Library in the DPN portal and can access robust courses that are designed to quickly onboard sales and technical teams. This includes technical content enablement and information on Datadog’s product, audience, and market.

### Certifications

Datadog offers specialization classes for technical, sales, and support employees. Partners must meet a minimum number of specialized individuals in order to qualify for Basic and Gold tiers.

**DPN Sales Specialist:** The DPN Sales Specialist certification path represents about 2 hours of self paced online training, followed by a knowledge test on Datadog’s product, market, and audience.

**DPN Technical Specialist:** The DPN Technical Specialist certification path consists of approximately 10-15 hours of self-paced online training followed by a certification exam. Note: The Datadog Fundamentals exam can be used for DPN Tech Specialist certification credit.

**DPN Support Specialist:** The DPN Support Specialist certification path consists of approximately 5 hours of self-paced online training followed by a certification exam.

**DPN Demo Certification:** The DPN Demo certification path equips sellers (including sales engineers/architects) on how to give Datadog product overviews or demonstrations.

### Partner Sandbox Subscription

Datadog provides access to sandbox Datadog accounts for use in demos and training. Technology Partners, Basic tier Partners and above may request a sandbox account through the portal.

### Partner Directory Listing

Technology Partners, Basic, and Gold tier Partners are able to access Datadog’s Partner Directory, which allows end customers to locate partners via the Datadog website.

### Partner Logo Use

Technology, Basic and Gold tier Partners may make use of the Datadog logo and/or the Datadog partner logos in their own marketing. Assets are available via the portal.

### DPN Marketing Collateral

Found within the Asset Library, DPN’s Marketing Collateral provides partners access to pre-built lead generation campaigns, relevant use cases, solution briefs, and more.

### Marketing Development Support Program

The MDS program allows Datadog to support Technology and Gold tier Partner-led and joint marketing activities focused on engaging and informing customers and prospects about Datadog products, services, and solutions. Under the MDS program, eligible DPN partners can request marketing support through the MDS Request Form in the DPN portal. If Datadog approves the requested MDS activities, Datadog will assign a Partner Marketing Manager to manage the engagement. Learn more about our MDS program in the partner portal Asset Library.

### Marketing Development Funds Program

The Marketing Development Funds (MDF) provides financial and logistical support to qualifying Gold tier DPN partners for planning and executing marketing activities intended to inform and engage customers and prospects about Datadog products, services, and solutions. Please note: MDF funds may also go towards marketing campaigns jointly carried out with Datadog. For MDF validation, Partners are required to include legal customer consent language on their campaign landing page and report on partner-generated leads following the campaign. Learn more about our MDF program in the Partner portal Asset Library.

### “Powered by Datadog” Program

Consulting & SI and Managed Services Provider members are eligible at the Gold tier to offer a service wherein the use of the Datadog platform is embedded, and deployed to all end clients who consume the service. For example, a Consulting & SI partner may choose to offer a “Public Cloud Migration” service, describing the activities they perform to help an end-client migrate applications and infrastructure from on-premise data centers to one or more public cloud environments. As part of that offering, the Consulting & SI company may offer a monitoring or observability track, using the Datadog platform, as part of the scope of work carried out for the client. Similarly, a Managed Services Provider partner may offer one or more managed services using a selection of technologies (together, considered a “service delivery platform”) where Datadog is the primary platform used for observability use cases.

The “Powered by Datadog” program rewards those partners where the Datadog platform is used for 3 or more observability use cases (e.g. Infrastructure, Applications, Logs) for all clients who subscribe to the partner’s service offering. Partners meeting the requirements with their service offering(s) will have access to the “Powered by Datadog” logo to use in support of their marketing efforts.

### Agreements

The DPPA is a single consolidated agreement that which contains all the terms and conditions that apply to all commercial partners (i.e., Resellers, MSPs, and Consultants & SI partners) along with a short addendum that which contains the program-specific terms that apply to each individual program.
Note for commercial partners, we are no longer using the MPPA, MSP Addendum, Reseller Addendum, and Consultant & SI Addendum.

### Datadog Service Offering
#### Required for Basic and Gold tier MSP and Consulting / SI partners

Consulting / SI and Managed Services Provider members are required at the Basic tier and above to offer a service materially related to the use of Datadog’s observability platform. For example, a Consulting / SI partner may choose to offer a “Datadog Implementation” service around one or more pillars of observability (metrics, traces, logs).

Similarly, a Managed Services Provider partner may offer “Datadog Managed Services” inclusive of activities such as end-user onboarding, client billing, and first-line support. Within the first twelve months of joining the Basic tier, partners are required to provide a publicly - accessible landing page describing the service(s) they offer based on the Datadog platform.

### Active Drawdown Contract
#### Required for Gold tier MSP partners

MSP partners at the Gold Tier are required to have in place a drawdown-style contract with Datadog. Datadog offers annual, month-to-month, and drawdown -style contracts, with drawdown being strongly recommended for MSPs overall and required at the Gold level.

### Bookings
#### Required for all Basic and Gold tier partners

Basic and Gold tier Partners are required to meet minimum booking quotas, based on Datadog’s evaluation of the previous 12 months of sales activity. For the MSP Track, the quota is calculated as the total value of fees paid by the partner under MSP partner Orders.
