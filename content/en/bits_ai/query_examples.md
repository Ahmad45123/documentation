# Example natural language queries

For instructions on running natural language queries in Datadog, see [Querying in a search bar][1] and [Querying in the chat panel][2].

## Logs
You can query your logs in natural language from the Logs Explorer search bar.

- "Find errors in AWS CloudTrail where a user is assuming a different user's role"
[SCREENSHOT cloudtrail-user-role-errors]
- "Create a pie chart of error logs by service"
[SCREENSHOT logs-pie-chart]
- "Show me patterns of errors for users checking out"
[SCREENSHOT checkout-error-patterns]

## APM traces

To query APM traces, use the chat panel.

Examples: [SCREENSHOTS FOR EACH BELOW]
- "Show me traces for web-store that are slower than 1s"
[SCREENSHOT slow-web-store-traces]

## Infrastructure data (Inventories SQL)

Infrastructure resource data can be queried in natural language from the search bar of [Inventories SQL][3], a centralized interface for infrastructure resource data. You can also use the chat panel to query infrastructure data from anywhere in Datadog.

Examples:
- "How many hosts am I running by availability zone?"
[SCREENSHOT hosts-by-az]
- "Show me the security groups open to the Internet"
[SCREENSHOT open-security-groups]

## Cloud cost

Natural language querying of cloud cost is available through the in-product search bar or the chat panel.

Examples:
- "How much does the payments team spend?"
[SCREENSHOT payments-team-spend]
- "Show me the costs for the web-store service"
[SCREENSHOT web-store-service-cost]
- "Break down cost by team"
[SCREENSHOT cost-by-team]
