[WARNING]
The following features are part of the [Datadog Incident Management][2] product.

## Prerequisites

- The "Mirror all incident Slack channel messages to its incident timeline in real-time" option must be turned on in your Incident Settings. This enables Datadog to generate summaries and postmortems from Slack conversations.
- The incident channel name must be prefixed with `#incident-`. This enables you to use the Bits AI chatbot in Slack (`@Datadog`) to ask questions about the incident or give updates on it.
