## Overview

The **OAuth Apps** management page in [Organization Settings][1] helps you manage and gain visibility into your organizationâ€™s OAuth applications, such as the scopes and permissions granted to an application and the users that have authorized access for it. This includes the Datadog Mobile App and your custom [Datadog Apps][2] created through the Developer Platform that have the [OAuth API Access][3] feature enabled.

## Permissions

By default, users with [Datadog Admin and Datadog Standard roles][4] can access the OAuth Apps management page. 

If your organization has [custom roles][5] defined, add your user to any custom role with `org_authorized_apps_read` and `org_authorized_apps_write` permissions. Only users with the `org_authorized_apps_write` permissions can manage OAuth applications on this page, such as disabling applications or revoking OAuth access for a user.

## Disable an OAuth application

Disabling OAuth access for an application revokes access to this application for all users in your organization. While the application remains installed, users are no longer able to use the application and will be prompted with an error if they attempt to authorize it.

There are two ways to disable an application from the OAuth Apps management page:
1. Hover over your application in the apps list to reveal the *Disable* button on the right-hand side of the row.

2. Click on your application to open up a detailed breakdown of the application and reveal the *Disable Application* button.

**Note**:
- Re-enabling an application allows users with necessary permissions to grant it access on their behalf. Users that have previously authorized the application are required to re-authorize the application to gain access again.

## Revoke OAuth access for a user
Revoking OAuth access to an application will remove all access that a user has to the application. If the user has the required permissions to authorize the application, they can gain access again by re-authorizing it.
