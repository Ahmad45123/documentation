## SOURCES: Data sources that Observability Pipelines Worker collects data from.
## For a Splunk use case, we are receiving data from a Splunk index.
sources:
  splunk_hec_receiver:
    type: splunk_hec
    address: 0.0.0.0:8088
    valid_tokens:
        - ${SPLUNK_TOKEN}

  ## This source receives log data directly from Splunk Universal and
  ## Heavy Forwarders (with attendant tcpout configuration).
  splunk_forwarders:
    type: socket
    address: 0.0.0.0:8099
    mode: tcp
    host_key: ""
    port_key: ""

transforms:
  ## This step removes an unnecessary attribute from logs received from
  ## Splunk Forwarders.
  splunk_forwarder_cleanup:
    type: remap
    inputs:
      - splunk_forwarders
    source: |-
      del(.source_type)

  ## This is a placeholder for your own remap (or other transform)
  ## steps with tags set up. Datadog recommends these tag assignments.
  ## They show which data has been moved over to OP and what still needs
  ## to be moved.
  logs_enrich:
    type: remap
    inputs:
      - splunk_hec_receiver
      - splunk_forwarder_cleanup
    source: |
      .sender = "observability_pipelines_worker"
      .opw_aggregator = get_hostname!()

## This buffer configuration is split into 144GB buffers for both of the Datadog and Splunk sinks.
##
## This should work for the vast majority of OP Worker deployments and should rarely
## need to be adjusted. If you do change it, be sure to update the size of the persistence
## block above.
##
## The "${DD_API_KEY}", "${SPLUNK_HEC_ENDPOINT}", and "${SPLUNK_TOKEN}" parameters are automatically replaced
## by the settings you provisioned earlier.
